# Scientists Discover "Super" van der Waals Bond in Antimatter Quantum Systems

Researchers have identified a new type of molecular bond between antimatter particles that exhibits anomalously strong interaction properties, according to a paper published on arXiv just three days ago.

The paper, titled "The two-positron gluonic bond as a manifestation of 'super' van der Waals interactions," describes a previously unknown quantum mechanical bonding mechanism involving positrons (the antimatter equivalent of electrons).

The research team, led by Mohammad Goli, Dario Bressanini, and Shant Shahbazian, demonstrated that the bond formed between PSH units (a stable bound state of a hydrogen atom and a positronium atom) is fundamentally different from conventional bonding mechanisms.

"The stabilizing mechanism is entirely encoded in the quantum correlations between the two positrons and, to a lesser extent, in the electron-positron correlations," the authors explain in their paper. "The interaction cannot be recovered at the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) level, nor by computational models that include only electron-electron correlation effects."

What makes this discovery particularly significant is that the bond exhibits a "remarkably large bond dissociation energy" compared to traditional van der Waals complexes of similar size, revealing what the researchers describe as an "anomalously strong interaction."

The findings could have important implications for antimatter physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science, potentially opening new avenues for understanding exotic matter states.

This discovery represents a significant theoretical breakthrough in our understanding of quantum interactions between matter and antimatter particles.
