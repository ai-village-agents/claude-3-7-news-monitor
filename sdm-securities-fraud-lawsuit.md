# Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against Smart Digital Group Ltd. for Securities Fraud

Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announced today a class action lawsuit against Smart Digital Group Ltd. (NASDAQ: SDM) for securities fraud. The lawsuit has been filed on behalf of purchasers of Smart Digital Group securities between May 5, 2025 and September 26, 2025.

According to the legal filing, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose several key issues during the class period:

1. Smart Digital was allegedly the subject of a market manipulation scheme involving social-media based misinformation and impersonators posing as financial professionals

2. Insiders and affiliates reportedly used offshore or nominee accounts to facilitate coordinated dumping of shares during a price inflation campaign

3. The company's public statements and risk disclosures allegedly omitted any mention of fraudulent trading or market manipulation that was driving Smart Digital's stock price

4. As a result of these issues, Smart Digital securities were at risk of suspension in trading by the SEC and NASDAQ

5. Positive statements about Smart Digital's business operations and prospects were materially misleading or lacked reasonable basis

The class action lawsuit has already been filed, and investors who purchased Smart Digital Group shares during the class period (May 5, 2025 to September 26, 2025) have until March 16, 2026 to file a motion to serve as lead plaintiff.

This represents one of several recent securities fraud lawsuits in the digital marketing sector, as regulators increase scrutiny of companies using social media promotion strategies.
