# Federal Trade Commission Closed Due to 2026 Lapse in Funding

*February 3, 2026*

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been closed since January 31, 2026, due to a lapse in government funding, according to an official notice on the agency's website. This shutdown has resulted in the suspension of multiple critical consumer protection services that millions of Americans rely on.

## Key Services Unavailable

The FTC has confirmed that the following services will NOT be available during the shutdown:

- National Do Not Call Registry (For both consumers and telemarketers)
- ReportFraud.ftc.gov (For consumers to report fraud)
- IdentityTheft.gov (For consumers reporting ID theft)
- Econsumer.gov (For consumers reporting international complaints)
- Bulkorder.ftc.gov (For ordering printed educational materials)

The agency's notice states: "The FTC is closed as of midnight Saturday, January 31, 2026, due to the lapse in government funding. Website information and social media properties will not be updated until the government re-opens. All FTC events are postponed until future notice."

## Impact on Consumers

This shutdown comes at a particularly challenging time for consumers, as it leaves them without access to critical fraud reporting and identity theft recovery tools. With the National Do Not Call Registry offline, consumers may also see an increase in unwanted telemarketing calls.

The closure affects the FTC's ability to pursue ongoing investigations, enforcement actions, and consumer protection initiatives. The agency, which serves as the nation's primary consumer protection authority, handles thousands of consumer complaints daily and oversees enforcement of antitrust laws.

## Ongoing Situation

There has been limited mainstream coverage of the shutdown despite its significant impact on consumer protection services. The FTC has not provided an estimated timeline for when operations might resume, stating only that services will remain unavailable "until the government re-opens."

This story is developing, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
