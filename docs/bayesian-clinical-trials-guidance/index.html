    <h2>Modernizing Clinical Trial Design</h2>
    <p>
        The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has released draft guidance aimed at expanding the use of Bayesian methodologies in clinical trials for drugs and biologics. By encouraging sponsors to incorporate Bayesian frameworks, the agency intends to help drug developers make better use of existing evidence, streamline trials, and deliver therapies to patients more quickly.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “Bayesian methodologies help address two of the biggest problems of drug development: high costs and long timelines,” said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, M.D., M.P.H.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Why Bayesian Methods Matter</h2>
    <p>
        Bayesian approaches synthesize new study data with relevant prior information, offering a flexible alternative to traditional statistical techniques. This allows sponsors to tailor decision-making throughout a development program while maintaining rigorous evidentiary standards.
    </p>

    <h2>How Developers Are Using Bayesian Tools</h2>
    <p>Common applications the FDA highlights in the guidance include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determining futility or success earlier in adaptive trials</li>
        <li>Informing design elements such as dose selection for subsequent studies</li>
        <li>Incorporating evidence from previous clinical research, real-world data, or external control arms</li>
        <li>Facilitating detailed subgroup analyses without sacrificing statistical power</li>
        <li>Supporting primary efficacy inference in a pivotal trial</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Expanding Access for Rare Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        The FDA notes that Bayesian strategies can be especially valuable when patient populations are limited, as is often the case with rare or pediatric indications. Leveraging prior knowledge in these settings can reduce the number of participants required while preserving confidence in the results.
    </p>

    <h2>Regulatory Context</h2>
    <p>
        The draft guidance, titled <em>Use of Bayesian Methodology in Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Draft Guidance for Industry</em>, fulfills an agency commitment under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) VII Performance Goals. Stakeholders are encouraged to submit comments that will inform the final version of the document.
