    <h1>Statement of Policy on Applications for Early Termination of Consent Orders</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:52</div>
    <div class="summary">The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) provides that the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) may enter into administrative consent orders (Consent Orders) where the Bureau has identified violations of Federal consumer financial law. The Bureau recognizes that there may be exceptional circumstances where it is appropriate to terminate a Consent Order before its original expiration date. To facilitate such early terminations where appropriate, this policy statement sets forth a process by which an entity subject to a Consent Order may apply for early termination and articulates the standards that the Bureau intends to use when evaluating early termination applications.</div>
