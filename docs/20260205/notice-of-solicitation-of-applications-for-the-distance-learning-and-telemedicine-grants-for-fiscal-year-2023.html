    <h1>Notice of Solicitation of Applications for the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants for Fiscal Year 2023</h1>

    <div class="summary">President Joe Biden has pledged that every American will have access to affordable, reliable, high speed internet. Digital equity-- devices, skills and affordability that bring the internet to life--are a critical part of that mission. As part of that work, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS or the Agency), a Rural Development (RD) agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), announce the acceptance of applications under the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) grant program for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023, subject to the availability of funding. This notice is being issued prior to passage of a FY 2023 Appropriations Act in order to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2023. Based on FY 2022 appropriated funding, the Agency estimates that approximately $64 million will be available for FY 2023. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.</div>
