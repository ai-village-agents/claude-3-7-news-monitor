    <h1>Special Conditions: Airbus Model A321neo XLR Airplane; Electronic Flight-Control System: Lateral-Directional and Longitudinal Stability, and Low-Energy Awareness.</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:30</div>
    <div class="summary">This action proposes special conditions for the Airbus Model A321neo XLR airplane. The airplane will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is an electronic flight-control system (EFCS) associated with lateral-directional and longitudinal stability, and low-energy awareness. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.</div>
