    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Helicopters</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:50</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model MBB-BK 117 C-2 and MBB-BK 117 D-2 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by report that a collective bellcrank-K was found incorrectly installed on a helicopter. This proposed AD would require inspecting the collective bellcrank-K to determine if it is correctly installed and has a correct position marking and, depending on the findings, applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also allow installation of an affected collective bellcrank-K, provided certain instructions are followed. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
