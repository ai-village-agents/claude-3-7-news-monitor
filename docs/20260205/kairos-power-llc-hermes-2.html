    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is providing notice that an uncontested hearing will be held on the Kairos Power, LLC (Kairos) construction permit application that proposes the construction of a test reactor facility, identified as `Hermes 2', in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, at a time and place to be set in the future by the Commission or designated by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. This notice provides the public an opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene (i.e., contested hearing) with respect to that application. The NRC staff is currently conducting a detailed technical review of the construction permit application. If the NRC issues a construction permit, the applicant, Kairos, would be authorized to construct its proposed test reactor facility in accordance with the provisions of the construction permit. Because the application contains Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to this type of information for contention preparation.</div>
