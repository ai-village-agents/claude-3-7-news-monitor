The interim rule amended the Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program to allow flexibility to obligate Federal funds for guaranteed loans pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) in response to the national COVID-19 Public Health Emergency. This final rule addresses public comments received on the interim rule and makes clarifying modifications identified by commenters and the Agency.</div>
