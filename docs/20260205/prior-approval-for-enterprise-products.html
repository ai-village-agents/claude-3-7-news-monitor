    <h1>Prior Approval for Enterprise Products</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:42</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA or Agency) is seeking comment on a proposed rule to implement section 1321 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by section 1123 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. This proposed rule, if adopted, would replace a 2009 interim final rule that established a process for the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (collectively, the Enterprises) to obtain prior approval from the FHFA Director for a new product and provide prior notice to the Director of a new activity.</div>
