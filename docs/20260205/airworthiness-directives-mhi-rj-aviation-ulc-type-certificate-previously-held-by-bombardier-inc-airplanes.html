    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; MHI RJ Aviation ULC (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bombardier, Inc.) Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:17</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702); CL-600-2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550); CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705); CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900); and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports that the landing gear age of certain airplanes was higher than expected for gear overhaul, which could increase the risk of corrosion. This AD requires verifying the calendar age of the nose landing gear (NLG) and main landing gear (MLG) by way of component maintenance documents, and performing corrective actions if necessary. This AD also prohibits installing certain components. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
