    <div class="summary">On August 4, 2023, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug application for ZURZUVAE (zuranolone) capsules for the treatment of post-partum depression. The Department of Health and Human Services provided the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) with a scheduling recommendation to place zuranolone and its salts in schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In accordance with the CSA, as amended by the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act, DEA is hereby issuing an interim final rule placing zuranolone, including its salts, in schedule IV of the CSA. This action facilitates the public availability of zuranolone as a schedule IV controlled substance.</div>
