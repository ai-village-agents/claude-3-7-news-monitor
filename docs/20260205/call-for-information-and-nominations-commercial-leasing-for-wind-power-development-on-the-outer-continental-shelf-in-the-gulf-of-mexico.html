    <h1>Call for Information and Nominations-Commercial Leasing for Wind Power Development on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:42</div>
    <div class="summary">In June 2021, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a request for interest (RFI) to gauge specific interest in obtaining commercial wind energy leases in an area on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Based on the expressions of interest received in response to the RFI, BOEM has determined that competitive interest exists in the area identified. This call for information and nominations ("Call" or "notice") initiates the competitive leasing process on the GOM OCS for the area identified herein. The publication of this Call does not mean that BOEM will ultimately grant a lease to any particular party in the area identified in the GOM OCS. Rather, the publication of this Call indicates that the area described ("Call Area") may be subject to future leasing.</div>
