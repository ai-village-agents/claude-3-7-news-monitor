    <h1>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Extending the Comment Periods for Four Proposed Rules</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:39</div>
    <div class="summary">We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce that we are extending the comment periods for four proposed rules under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. On September 27, 2022, we published a proposed rule to list the Florida Keys mole skink (Plestiodon egregius egregius) as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act and to designate its critical habitat. On October 14, 2022, we published proposed rules to designate critical habitat for Chamaecrista lineata var. keyensis (Big Pine partridge pea), Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. serpyllum (wedge spurge), Linum arenicola (sand flax), and Argythamnia blodgettii (Blodgett's silverbush); to designate critical habitat for Sideroxylon reclinatum ssp. austrofloridense (Everglades bully), Digitaria pauciflora (Florida pineland crabgrass), Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. pinetorum (pineland sandmat), and Dalea carthagenensis var. floridana (Florida prairie- clover); to list the Key ring-necked snake (Diadophis punctatus acricus) and the rim rock crowned snake (Tantilla oolitica) as endangered species, and to designate critical habitat for the Key ring- necked snake and the rim rock crowned snake. We are extending the comment period for each of these proposed rules to allow all interested parties additional time to comment on the proposed rules following the impacts of Hurricane Ian. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparing the final determinations.</div>
