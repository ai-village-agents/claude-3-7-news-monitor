    <h1>Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Amendment 124 to the BSAI FMP for Groundfish and Amendment 112 to the GOA FMP for Groundfish To Revise IFQ Program Regulations</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:12:25</div>
    <div class="summary">The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 124 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP) and Amendment 112 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA FMP) to the Secretary of Commerce for review. If approved, Amendment 124 to the BSAI FMP and Amendment 112 to the GOA FMP would authorize the use of jig gear in the sablefish individual fishing quota (IFQ) and community development quota (CDQ) programs. Amendment 124 would also remove the residency requirements for Community Quota Entity (CQE). These amendments are intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the FMPs, and other applicable laws.</div>
