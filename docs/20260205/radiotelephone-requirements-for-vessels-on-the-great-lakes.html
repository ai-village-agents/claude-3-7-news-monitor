    <div class="summary">In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) amends its rules to retain the radiotelephone requirements for vessels subject to the current Great Lakes Agreement (GLA or Agreement). The GLA is a treaty between the United States and Canada. In relevant part, the GLA established requirements regarding the usage and maintenance of radiocommunications equipment for safety purposes aboard certain vessels navigating on the Great Lakes. Pursuant to Canada's notice of termination on November 2, 2022, the GLA will cease to be effective on November 2, 2023. As a result, the FCC takes expedited action in this order to amend subpart T and certain other parts of the Commission's rules to remove the references to the GLA and maintain the applicability of rules in the Great Lakes.</div>
