    <h1>Proposed Expansion of the Clarksburg Viticultural Area</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:30:41</div>
    <div class="summary">The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to expand the approximately 64,640-acre "Clarksburg" viticultural area by approximately 27,945 acres. The Clarksburg viticultural area is located in Sacramento, Solano, and Yolo Counties, in California, and the proposed expansion area is located in Sacramento and Solano Counties. The established Clarksburg viticultural area and the proposed expansion area are not located within any established viticultural area. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on this proposed amendment to its regulations.</div>
