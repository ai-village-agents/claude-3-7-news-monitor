    <h1>Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:39</div>
    <div class="summary">In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), the OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (the agencies) may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. On July 22, 2021, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), requested public comment for 60 days on proposals to revise and extend for three years the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) (FFIEC 031, FFIEC 041, and FFIEC 051), which is currently an approved collection of information. The agencies requested comment on proposed changes to the instructions for reporting of deferred tax assets (DTAs) and to add a new item related to the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). The comment period for the notice has closed. The agencies are adding the new item related to SA-CCR as proposed. The agencies are deferring the proposed changes to the instructions for reporting of DTAs until a future notice, which will also provide an opportunity for additional comment on the instructions. The agencies hereby give notice of their plan to submit to OMB a request to approve the revision and extension of these information collections and again invite comment on the renewal.</div>
