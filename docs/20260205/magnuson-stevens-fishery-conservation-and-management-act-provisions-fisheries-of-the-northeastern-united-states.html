    <div class="summary">This rule announces the approval of, and regulations to implement, an action to require commercially permitted vessels in both the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council regions to submit vessel trip reports electronically within 48 hours of the end of a trip. This action will also require for-hire vessels with permits for species managed by the New England Fishery Management Council to submit vessel trip reports electronically within 48 hours of the end of a trip. Document retention requirements will be removed with this action. This action is intended to increase data quality and timeliness of vessel trip reports.</div>
