    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:21</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE or the Department) proposes to amend its implementing procedures (regulations) governing compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The proposed changes would add a categorical exclusion for certain energy storage systems and revise categorical exclusions for upgrading and rebuilding transmission lines and for solar photovoltaic systems, as well as make conforming changes to related sections of DOE's NEPA regulations. The proposed changes are based on the experience of DOE and other Federal agencies, current technologies, regulatory requirements, and accepted industry practice. DOE invites public comments on the proposed changes.</div>
