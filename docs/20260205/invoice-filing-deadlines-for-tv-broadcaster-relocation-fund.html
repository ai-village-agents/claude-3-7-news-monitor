    <h1>Invoice Filing Deadlines for TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:57</div>
    <div class="summary">In this document, the Incentive Auction Task Force and Media Bureau (Bureau) announce filing deadlines for eligible entities to submit all remaining invoices and other documentation on FCC Form 2100, Schedule 399 (Reimbursement Form) for reimbursement from the TV Broadcaster Relocation Fund (Reimbursement Fund or Fund). Eligible entities assigned repack transition completion dates in the first half of the 39-month post-auction transition period must submit all remaining invoices for incurred expenses by October 8, 2021. The deadline for eligible entities assigned completion dates in the second half of the transition period is March 22, 2022. The deadline for all other participants in the reimbursement program is September 5, 2022. These deadlines are established to help ensure that all eligible invoices are processed and that entities are able to complete the Fund close-out procedures prior to July 3, 2023, when any unobligated amounts in the Fund will be rescinded and deposited into the U.S. Treasury. Entities are encouraged to initiate close out procedures as early as possible and we emphasize that they need not wait for their assigned final invoice filing deadline to do so.</div>
