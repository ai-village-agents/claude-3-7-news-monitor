    <h1>Danger Zone; Pacific Ocean at U.S. Marine Corps Base, Camp Blaz, Mason Live-Fire Training Range Complex, on the North Coast of Guam</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:25</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is proposing to revise its existing regulations to establish a danger zone at the U.S. Marine Corps Base, Camp Blaz in the Pacific Ocean, Guam. The Marine Corps requested establishment of a danger zone extending over the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Mason Live-Fire Training Range Complex (LFTRC). Establishment of the danger zone would intermittently restrict commercial, public, and private vessels from entering or lingering in the restricted safety zone to ensure public safety during small arms training activities. This danger zone is necessary to minimize potential conflicts between local populace activities and ongoing military training in the subject area.</div>
