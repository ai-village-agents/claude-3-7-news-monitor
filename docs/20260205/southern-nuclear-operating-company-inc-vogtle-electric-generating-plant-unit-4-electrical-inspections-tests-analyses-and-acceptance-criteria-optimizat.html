    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is granting an exemption to allow a departure from the Tier 1 information in the plant-specific design control document (DCD) and is issuing License Amendment No. 187 to Combined License (COL) NPF-92. The COL was issued to Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. (SNC); Georgia Power Company; Oglethorpe Power Corporation; MEAG Power SPVM, LLC; MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC; MEAG Power SPVP, LLC; and the City of Dalton, Georgia; for the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 4, located in Burke County, Georgia. SNC is the entity that is licensed to construct and operate VEGP Unit 4. The granting of the exemption allows the departure from Tier 1 information asked for in the amendment. Because the acceptability of the exemption was determined in part by the acceptability of the amendment, the exemption and amendment are being issued concurrently.</div>
