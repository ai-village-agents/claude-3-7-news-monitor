    <div class="summary">In accordance with the General Provisions of the Exchange Visitor Program regulations, the Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA), U.S. Department of State extends the waiver and modification of certain regulatory requirements with respect to a temporary educational and cultural exchange program established pursuant to an arrangement between the Government of the United States and the Government of Ukraine. Under the original arrangement for Special Student Relief, eligible Ukrainian college and university students on J-1 visas who have continuously resided in the United States since April 11, 2022, could carry lighter course loads and work full- or part- time, on or off campus until October 23, 2023. Under the modified and extended arrangement, eligible Ukrainian college and university students on J-1 visas who have continuously resided in the United States since August 16, 2023, may carry lighter course loads and work full- or part-time, on or off campus until April 19, 2025. This arrangement was established to ameliorate these students' financial and other hardships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</div>
