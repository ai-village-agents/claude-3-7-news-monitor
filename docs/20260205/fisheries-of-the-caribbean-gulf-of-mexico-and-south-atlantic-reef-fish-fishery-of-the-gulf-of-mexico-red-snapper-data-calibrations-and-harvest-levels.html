    <div class="summary">NMFS issues regulations to implement management measures described in two framework actions under the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) Fishery Management Council (Council). This final rule modifies the state-specific red snapper private angling components annual catch limits (ACLs) to reflect each state's monitoring program. In addition, this final rule modifies commercial and recreational sector and recreational component red snapper ACLs and annual catch targets (ACTs) in the Gulf exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The purpose of this final rule is to calibrate Gulf red snapper state private angling component ACLs to reduce the likelihood of overfishing, to increase the Gulf red snapper ACLs and ACTs consistent with the best scientific information available, and to continue to achieve optimum yield (OY) for the stock.</div>
