    <h1>Beat the Street Interiors, Inc.-Grant of Petition for Temporary Exemption From Shoulder Belt Requirement for Side-Facing Seats on Motorcoaches</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:42</div>
    <div class="summary">This notice grants the petition of Beat the Street Interiors, Inc. ("BTS") for a temporary exemption from a shoulder belt requirement of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208, "Occupant crash protection," for side-facing seats on motorcoaches. This grant permits the petitioner to install Type 1 seat belts (lap belt only) at side-facing seating positions instead of the Type 2 seat belts (lap and shoulder belts) required by FMVSS No. 208. After reviewing the petition, the agency has determined that the requested exemption is warranted to enable the petitioner to sell a vehicle whose overall level of safety or impact protection is at least equal to that of a nonexempted vehicle.</div>
