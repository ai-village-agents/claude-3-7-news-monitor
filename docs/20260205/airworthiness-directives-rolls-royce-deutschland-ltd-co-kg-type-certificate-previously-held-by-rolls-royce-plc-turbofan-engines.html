    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (Type Certificate Previously Held by Rolls-Royce plc) Turbofan Engines</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:33</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd. & Co KG (RRD) Trent 1000 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by the manufacturer revising the engine Time Limits Manual (TLM) life limits of certain critical rotating parts and direct accumulation counting data files. This AD requires the operator to revise the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of their existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP) by incorporating the revised tasks of the applicable TLM for each affected model turbofan engine, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
