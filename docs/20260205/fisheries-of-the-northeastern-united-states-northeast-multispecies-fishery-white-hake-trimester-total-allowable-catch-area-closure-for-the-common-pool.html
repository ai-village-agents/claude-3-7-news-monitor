    <h1>Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Northeast Multispecies Fishery; White Hake Trimester Total Allowable Catch Area Closure for the Common Pool Fishery</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:23:56</div>
    <div class="summary">This action closes the White Hake Trimester Total Allowable Catch Area to Northeast multispecies common pool vessels fishing with trawl gear, sink gillnet gear, and longline/hook gear, except Handgear A and Handgear B vessels, through December 31, 2023. The closure is required because the common pool fishery is projected to have caught 90 percent of its Trimester 2 quota for white hake. This closure is intended to prevent an overage of the common pool's quota for this stock.</div>
