    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) has identified certain class II clinical electronic thermometers that, when finalized, will be exempt from premarket notification requirements, subject to certain limitations. FDA is publishing this notice of that determination and requesting public comment in accordance with the procedures established by the 21st Century Cures Act. FDA will review any comments submitted within the 60-day comment period and will consider whether any modifications should be made to the exemption for certain clinical electronic thermometers prior to publication of its final determination in the Federal Register.</div>
