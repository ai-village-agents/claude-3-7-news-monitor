    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Martin Corporation/Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:44</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 96-12-20, which applied to certain Lockheed Martin Corporation/Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G airplanes. AD 96-12-20 required visual inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners in the upper truss mounts of certain engines, visual inspections to detect cracking in the associated lugs, repetitive ultrasonic inspections to detect cracking of the upper lugs, and replacement of damaged or cracked parts. AD 96-12-20 also provided for an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This AD was prompted by reports of fatigue cracking of the lugs of the upper truss mount, and by reports of cracks found prior to the initial inspection times required by AD 96-12-20 and the determination that the terminating action is no longer valid. This AD requires one-time inspections for cracked or severed engine truss mount upper lugs of the outboard engines, and replacement of the engine truss mount if necessary. This AD also revises the applicability to include all Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G airplanes, and all Model EC-130Q, C-130H, HP-C-130A, C-130A, and C-130B (including Model 282- 44A-05) airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
