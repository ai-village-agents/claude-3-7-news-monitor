    <h1>Extension of Tolerances for Emergency Exemptions; Multiple Chemicals</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:30</div>
    <div class="summary">This regulation extends time-limited tolerances for residues of clothianidin, kasugamycin, methyl bromide, and triclopyr in or on various commodities as identified in this document. These actions are in response to EPA's granting of emergency exemptions under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) authorizing use of these pesticides. In addition, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires EPA to establish a time-limited tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for pesticide chemical residues in food that will result from the use of a pesticide under an emergency exemption granted by EPA under FIFRA. Additionally, EPA is removing time-limited tolerances for residues of flupyradifurone in or on sugar cane and sweet sorghum commodities.</div>
