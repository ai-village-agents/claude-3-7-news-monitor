    <h1>National Defense Authorization Act of 2020, Definition of Surviving Spouse for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Change to 8(a) Business Development Contracting Thresholds</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:36</div>
    <div class="summary">This rule makes technical changes to regulations issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to conform those regulations to recent statutory changes. First, the rule incorporates a required change to SBA's ownership requirements for small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. The rule adopts changes to the treatment of certain surviving spouses made by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020. In addition, the rule incorporates changes to the dollar thresholds for certain contracting actions authorized for the 8(a) Business Development (BD) program made by the National Defense Authorization Act of 2020. Finally, the rule adjusts the competitive threshold dollar levels authorized for SBA's contracting programs to changes made to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) due to inflation.</div>
