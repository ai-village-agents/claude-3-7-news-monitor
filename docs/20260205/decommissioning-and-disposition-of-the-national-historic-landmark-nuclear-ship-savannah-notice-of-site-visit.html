    <h1>Decommissioning and Disposition of the National Historic Landmark Nuclear Ship Savannah; Notice of Site Visit</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:47:45</div>
    <div class="summary">The Maritime Administration (MARAD) announces a site visit for the National Historic Landmark (NHL) Nuclear Ship Savannah (NSS). MARAD is decommissioning the nuclear power plant of the NSS, which will result in the termination of the ship's Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license, making the ship available for disposition, including potential conveyance or preservation. The site visit will provide interested parties an opportunity to learn more about the NSS to assist in determining if they may wish to consider acquiring the ship for preservation purposes, as prescribed in the recently executed Programmatic Agreement (PA) covering the decommissioning and disposition of the ship.</div>
