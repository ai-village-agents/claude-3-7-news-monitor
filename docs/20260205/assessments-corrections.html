    <h1>Assessments; Corrections</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:42</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is making technical amendments to its rules governing deposit insurance assessments in two places to conform regulatory text to the text that was adopted by the FDIC Board of Directors (FDIC Board). Due to publishing errors, incorrect text was printed in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations. The first amendment will conform the value of the weighted charge-off rate for loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties that appears in the FDIC's assessment regulations to the charge-off rate adopted by the FDIC Board. The second amendment will conform a footnote that defines two terms in the descriptions of the counterparty measures for purposes of deposit insurance assessments to the language adopted by the FDIC Board. The technical amendments will not affect assessments previously paid by insured depository institutions (IDIs) or assessments paid by IDIs in the future.</div>
