    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that the National Indian Gaming Commission has adopted its annual fee rates of 0.00% for tier 1 and 0.08% (.0008) for tier 2, which maintain the current fee rates. These rates shall apply to all assessable gross revenues from each gaming operation under the jurisdiction of the Commission. If a tribe has a certificate of self-regulation, the fee rate on Class II revenues shall be 0.04% (.0004) which is one-half of the annual fee rate. The annual fee rates are effective November 1, 2023, and will remain in effect until new rates are adopted. The National Indian Gaming Commission has also adopted its fingerprint processing fee of $53 per card which represents an increase of $8 per card. The fingerprint processing fee is effective November 1, 2023, and will remain in effect until the Commission adopts a new rate.</div>
