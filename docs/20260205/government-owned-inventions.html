    <div class="summary">The invention listed below is directed to a device to measure placental oxygen saturation in pregnant women from 20 weeks of pregnancy to delivery. The device monitors maternal tissue oxygen saturation, blood oxygen saturation, breathing rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability from signal, fetal movement activity and potentially fetal heart rate and heart rate variability. This technology was discovered and is being developed by the National Institute on Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The NICHD is currently seeking a licensee and/or collaborator to further develop this technology.</div>
