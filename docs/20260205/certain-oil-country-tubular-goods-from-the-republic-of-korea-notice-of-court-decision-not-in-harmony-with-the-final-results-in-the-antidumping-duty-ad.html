    <div class="summary">On October 16, 2020, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in NEXTEEL v. United States, Court No. 18-00083, sustaining the Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s remand redetermination concerning the final results in the antidumping duty (AD) administrative review of certain oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from the Republic of Korea (Korea), covering the period of review (POR) September 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016. Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment in this case is not in harmony with Commerce's final results in the administrative review of OCTG from Korea. Pursuant to the CIT's final judgment, Commerce is amending the weighted-average dumping margin calculated for SeAH Steel Corporation (SeAH), NEXTEEL Co., Ltd. (NEXTEEL), and non-examined companies.</div>
