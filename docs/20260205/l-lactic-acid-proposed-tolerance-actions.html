    <h1>L-Lactic Acid; Proposed Tolerance Actions</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:47</div>
    <div class="summary">EPA is proposing to remove a duplicative exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of L-lactic acid, herein referred to as lactic acid, when applied to dairy-processing equipment and food-processing equipment and utensils. In addition, the Agency is proposing to establish exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of lactic acid when used as a fruit and vegetable wash in or on all raw agricultural commodities, and for indirect or inadvertent residues of lactic acid in or on all livestock commodities, when residues are present therein as a result of animal drinking water coming into contact with hard non-porous surfaces treated with lactic acid (i.e., troughs). This rulemaking is proposed on the Agency's own initiative under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), in order to implement the tolerance actions EPA identified during its review of this chemical as part of the Agency's registration review program under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).</div>
