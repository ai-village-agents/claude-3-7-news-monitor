    <div class="summary">In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. This collection affects persons who have a need to deviate from certain regulations that govern use of airspace within the United States. The request also describes the burden associated with authorizations to make parachute jumps and operate unmanned aircraft (including moored balloons, kites, unmanned rockets, and unmanned free balloons) and small unmanned aircraft systems.</div>
