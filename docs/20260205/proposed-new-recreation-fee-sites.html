    <h1>Proposed New Recreation Fee Sites</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:59:19</div>
    <div class="summary">The Willamette National Forest is proposing to establish several new recreation fee sites. Recreation fee revenues collected at the new recreation fee sites would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvement of the sites. An analysis of nearby recreation fee sites with similar amenities shows the recreation fees that would be charged at the new recreation fee sites are reasonable and typical of similar recreation fee sites in the area.</div>
