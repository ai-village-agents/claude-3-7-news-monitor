    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:42</div>
    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on October 2, 2020 under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Toppan Interamerica, Inc. of McDonough, Georgia. Supplements to the complaint were filed on October 5, 2020, and October 21, 2020. The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain furniture products finished with decorative wood grain paper and components thereof by reason of infringement of U.S. Copyright Registration No. VA 2-142-287 ("the '287 copyright"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order.</div>
