The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain video processing devices and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 8,832,297 ("the '297 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 7,295,673 ("the '673 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,225,588 ("the '588 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 11,102,553 ("the '553 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 11,050,808 ("the '808 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.</div>
