    <h1>Agency Information Collection Activities: Requests for Comments; Clearance of a New Approval of Information Collection: Computerized Neurocognitive Tests for Aeromedical Safety</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:39</div>
    <div class="summary">In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on December 16, 2021. The collection involves in-person sessions between researchers and certified pilots. Computerized neurocognitive tests are a non-invasive way to measure cognitive function (e.g., attention, working memory, information processing speed, reaction time) and are used as part of the FAA's overall aeromedical physical exam process to determine if a pilot is safe to operate an aircraft within the National Airspace System (NAS). Neurocognitive tests are required only for pilots with certain medical conditions associated with aeromedically significant cognitive impairments (i.e., not all pilots are tested). The FAA needs to ensure that the tests and data used to maintain the safety of the NAS are based on the most current scientific knowledge. The purpose of this IC effort is to obtain updated pilot normative data for the neurocognitive tests under consideration. The information collection (IC) effort will be used to potentially revise the FAA's Aviation Medical Examiners (AME) Guide, update clinical practices, and assure aeromedical safety. Information will be collected from representative pilots across the United States, who will complete two different 1-hour neurocognitive tests. Total IC effort/time per person will be approximately four hours (i.e., to include check-in processing, informed consent, neurocognitive test-taking, rest breaks, and participant debrief).</div>
