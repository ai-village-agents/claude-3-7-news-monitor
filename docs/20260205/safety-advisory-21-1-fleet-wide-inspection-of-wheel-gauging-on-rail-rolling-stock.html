    <h1>Safety Advisory 21-1; Fleet-Wide Inspection of Wheel Gauging on Rail Rolling Stock</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:43</div>
    <div class="summary">As a result of the derailment of a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metrorail train on October 12, 2021, FTA has issued Safety Advisory 21-1 to direct State Safety Oversight Agencies (SSOAs) to report information to FTA regarding out-of-tolerance wheel gauges on all rail transit rolling stock in revenue service. The Safety Advisory also advises SSOAs to require fleet-wide inspections of wheel gauges at rail fixed guideway public transportation systems (RTAs) in their jurisdiction. A copy of Safety Advisory 21-1 can be found on the FTA website at https://www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/ safety/fta-safety-advisories.</div>
