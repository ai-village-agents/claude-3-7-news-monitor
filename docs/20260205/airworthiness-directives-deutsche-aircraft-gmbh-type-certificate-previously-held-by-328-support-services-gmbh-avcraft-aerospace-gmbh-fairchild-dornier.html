    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Deutsche Aircraft GmbH (Type Certificate Previously Held by 328 Support Services GmbH; AvCraft Aerospace GmbH; Fairchild Dornier GmbH; Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH) Airplanes</h1>

    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Deutsche Aircraft GmbH Model 328-100 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of finding cracks in fuselage frames (FR) 24 and FR26. This AD requires a one-time detailed and eddy current inspection of fuselage FR24 and FR26 (left and right sides), performing corrective actions if necessary, and reporting the inspection results, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
