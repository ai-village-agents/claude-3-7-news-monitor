    <h1>National Wildlife Refuge System; 2023-2024 Station-Specific Hunting and Sport Fishing Regulations</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:03</div>
    <div class="summary">We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), expand hunting opportunities on three National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs). We also make changes to existing station-specific regulations in order to reduce the regulatory burden on the public, increase access for hunters and anglers on Service lands and waters, and comply with a Presidential mandate for plain language standards. Finally, the best available science, analyzed as part of this rulemaking, indicates that lead ammunition and tackle have negative impacts on both wildlife and human health. In this rule, Blackwater, Chincoteague, Eastern Neck, Erie, Great Thicket, Patuxent Research Refuge, Rachel Carson, and Wallops Island NWRs each adopt a non-lead requirement, which will take effect on September 1, 2026. While the Service continues to evaluate the future of lead use in hunting and fishing on Service lands and waters, this rulemaking does not include any opportunities increasing or authorizing the new use of lead beyond fall 2026.</div>
