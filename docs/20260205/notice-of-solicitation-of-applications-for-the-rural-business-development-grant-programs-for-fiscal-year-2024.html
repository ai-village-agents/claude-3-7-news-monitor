    <h1>Notice of Solicitation of Applications for the Rural Business Development Grant Programs for Fiscal Year 2024</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:36:10</div>
    <div class="summary">The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS or the Agency) invites the submission of applications for grants under the Rural Business Development Grant (RBDG) Program for fiscal year (FY) 2024, subject to the availability of funding. This notice is being issued prior to passage of a FY 2024 Appropriations Act in order to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2024. Based on FY 2023 appropriated funding, the Agency estimates that approximately $37,000,000 will be available for FY 2024. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.</div>
