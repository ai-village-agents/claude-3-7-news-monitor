    <h1>Streamlining and Improvement of Single Family Housing Direct Programs</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:23:46</div>
    <div class="summary">The Rural Housing Service (RHS or the Agency), an agency in the Rural Development (RD) mission area of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), proposes to amend the current regulation for the following Single Family Housing (SFH) Direct Programs: Section 502 Direct Loan Program and the Section 504 Loan and Grant Program. The Agency also intends to update the Section 306C Loan and Grant Programs which is a program administered under the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), and where RHS is designated to make grants to eligible individuals. The intent of this proposed rule is to reduce the regulatory burdens on applicants, borrowers, and partners by enhancing program delivery, expanding customer service, promoting consistency between the direct and guaranteed SFH loan programs where feasible and aligning the programs with current housing market conditions and mortgage loan practices.</div>
