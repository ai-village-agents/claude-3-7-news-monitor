    <h1>Proposed Amendment of Class D and Class E Airspace; Tacoma Narrows Airport, WA</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:42</div>
    <div class="summary">This action proposes to amend the Class D airspace, Class E surface Airspace and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Tacoma Narrows Airport, Tacoma, WA. A review of the airspace was initiated due to corresponding reviews at McChord Field (Joint Base Lewis-McChord) and Gray AAF (Joint Base Lewis-McChord). All three locations were evaluated at the same time due to their close proximity to one another and operational interdependence. After a review of the airspace, the FAA found it necessary to amend the existing airspace for the safety and management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at this airport.</div>
