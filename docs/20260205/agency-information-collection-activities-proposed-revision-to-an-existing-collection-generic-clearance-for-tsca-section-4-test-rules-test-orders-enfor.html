    <div class="summary">In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), this document announces that EPA is planning to submit the following Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): "Generic Clearance for TSCA Section 4 Test Rules, Test Orders, Enforceable Consent Agreements (ECAs), Voluntary Data Submissions, and Exemptions from Testing Requirements)," and identified by EPA ICR No. 1139.25 and approved under OMB Control No. 2070-0033. This ICR incorporates the activities and burdens recently approved under a separate ICR entitled "User Guide for submitting TSCA Section 4 Test Order Information," and identified by EPA ICR No. 2697.01 and approved under OMB Control No. 2070-0215, which is scheduled to expire on April 30, 2022. Merging these ICRs before that expiration is appropriate because the activities are integrated components of the same information collection program. Before submitting the ICR to OMB for review and approval under the PRA, EPA is soliciting comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection that is summarized in this document. The ICR and accompanying material are available in the docket for public review and comment.</div>
