    <div class="summary">As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) requests comments on a proposed extension of approval of a collection of information from persons who may voluntarily participate in consumer focus groups, and revision of that collection. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) previously approved the collection of information under control number 3041-0136. OMB's most recent extension of approval will expire on January 31, 2024. The Commission will consider all comments received in response to this notice before requesting an extension and revision of this collection of information from OMB.</div>
