    <div class="summary">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its regulations by adding new regulations that would govern scholarship programs to certain health care professionals. This rulemaking implements the mandates of the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019 by establishing the Readjustment Counseling Service Scholarship Program (RCSSP). The RCSSP provides educational assistance to individuals who pursue a graduate degree in psychology, social work, marriage and family therapy, or mental health counseling that meet the education requirements for appointment as a health care professional in one of those fields in VA Vet Centers.</div>
