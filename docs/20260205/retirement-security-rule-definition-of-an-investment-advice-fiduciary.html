    <h1>Retirement Security Rule: Definition of an Investment Advice Fiduciary</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:35</div>
    <div class="summary">This document contains a proposed amendment to the regulation defining when a person renders "investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect" with respect to any moneys or other property of an employee benefit plan, for purposes of the definition of a "fiduciary" in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (Title I of ERISA or the Act). The proposal also would amend the parallel regulation defining for purposes of Title II of ERISA, a "fiduciary" of a plan defined in Internal Revenue Code (Code) section 4975, including an individual retirement account. The Department also is publishing elsewhere in today's Federal Register proposed amendments to Prohibited Transaction Exemption 2020-02 (Improving Investment Advice for Workers & Retirees) and to several other existing administrative exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules applicable to fiduciaries under Title I and Title II of ERISA.</div>
