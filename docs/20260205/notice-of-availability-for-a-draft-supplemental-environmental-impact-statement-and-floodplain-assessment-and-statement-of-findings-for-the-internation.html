    <h1>Notice of Availability for a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and Floodplain Assessment and Statement of Findings for the International Falls Land Port of Entry Modernization and Expansion Project in International Falls, Minnesota</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:36</div>
    <div class="summary">This notice announces the availability of the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS), which examines potential environmental impacts from the modernization and expansion of the International Falls Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in International Falls, Minnesota. The existing International Falls LPOE is owned and managed by GSA and is operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The Draft SEIS describes the purpose and need for the project; alternatives considered; the existing environment that could be affected; the potential impacts resulting from each of the alternatives; and proposed best management practices and/or mitigation measures. The Draft SEIS also includes the Draft Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA), which provides a floodplain assessment and statement of findings as a result of construction in a floodplain at the International Falls LPOE.</div>
