    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and NRC's regulations. This EA summarizes the results of the NRC staff's environmental review, which evaluates the potential environmental impacts of approving an alternate disposal request in response to a request from STP Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC) for Renewed Facility Operating Licenses NPF-76 and NPF-80 for South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2 (STP). Specifically, the alternate disposal request, if approved, would allow the licensee to dispose of very-low-level waste (VLLW) generated during day-to-day operations at the STP reactor site at Texas Class 1 or Class 2 industrial landfills.</div>
