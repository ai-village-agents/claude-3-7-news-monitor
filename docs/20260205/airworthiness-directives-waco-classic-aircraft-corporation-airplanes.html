    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; WACO Classic Aircraft Corporation Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:37</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain WACO Classic Aircraft Corporation Model 2T-1A-2 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of multiple types of cracks at the leading edge former ribs and trailing edge former ribs in the upper wing center section. This proposed AD would require installing maneuver restriction placards in the front and rear cockpits, inspecting the leading and trailing edge former ribs for cracking, replacing any cracked ribs, modifying the upper wing center section assembly, and removing the maneuver restriction placards after completing the modification. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
