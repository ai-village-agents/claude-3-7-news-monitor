    <h1>Revision of Information Collection: Combined Federal Campaign Applications</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:28</div>
    <div class="summary">In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces that the Office of Personnel Management requests approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew a previously approved information collection, Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) Charity Applications, OMB Control No. 3206-0269, OPM Forms 1647- A, -B, and -E. OPM uses these documents to review the eligibility of national, international, and local charitable organizations and Department of Defense morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR)/Family Support and Youth Activities/Programs (FSYA/FSYP) organizations that wish to participate in the CFC. The proposed revisions reflect improvements in the form instructions and the addition of optional fields for charities to detail the kinds of volunteer opportunities Federal employees might consider for personal service hours (outside working hours). On August 11, 2022, OPM published a 60-day notice and request for comments at 87 FR 49619. OPM received no comments. There are, therefore, no recommended revisions to this ICR. We estimate 6,000 responses to this information collection annually. Each form takes approximately two hours to complete. The annual estimated burden is 12,000 hours.</div>
