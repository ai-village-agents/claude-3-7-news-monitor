    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:23:55</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) developed a proposed barred owl management strategy (management strategy) to address the threat of the nonnative, invasive barred owl (Strix varia) to the native northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, this notice announces the availability of a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) evaluating the impacts on the human environment related to the proposed management strategy and associated take of barred owls, which is prohibited under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act unless authorized by the Service by permit or regulation. We invite public comments on the proposed management strategy and DEIS from the public and Federal, Tribal, State, and local governments.</div>
