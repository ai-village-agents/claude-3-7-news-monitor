    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:24</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR), "Performance Evaluation Studies on Wastewater Laboratories" (EPA ICR No. 0234.14, OMB Control No. 2080-0021) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Before doing so, EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below. This is a proposed extension of the ICR, which is currently approved through May 31, 2023. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</div>
