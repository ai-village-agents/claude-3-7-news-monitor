    <div class="summary">This final rule announces NHTSA's determination that there are no new model year (MY) 2021 light duty truck lines subject to the parts-marking requirements of the Federal motor vehicle theft prevention standard. The agency determined no new models were high- theft or had major parts that are interchangeable with a majority of the covered major parts of passenger car or multipurpose passenger vehicle lines. This final rule also identifies those vehicle lines that have been granted an exemption from the parts-marking requirements because they are equipped with antitheft devices determined to meet certain criteria. Lastly, this final rule identifies vehicle lines that have not been manufactured for the United States market in over 5 years.</div>
