    <h1>List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: TN Americas LLC, TN-32 Dry Storage Cask, Certificate of Compliance No. 1021, Renewal of Initial Certificate and Amendment No. 1</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:35</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its spent fuel regulations by revising the TN Americas LLC, TN-32 Dry Storage Cask listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to renew, for an additional 40 years, the initial certificate and Amendment No. 1 of Certificate of Compliance No. 1021. The renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment No. 1 revises the certificate of compliance's conditions and technical specifications to address aging management activities related to the structures, systems, and components of the dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain their intended functions during the period of extended storage operations. The scope of the Certificate of Compliance No. 1021 renewal includes spent fuel storage cask models TN-32, TN-32A, and TN-32B.</div>
