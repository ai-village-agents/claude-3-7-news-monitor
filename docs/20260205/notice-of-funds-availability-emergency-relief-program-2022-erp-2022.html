    <h1>Notice of Funds Availability; Emergency Relief Program 2022 (ERP 2022)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:51</div>
    <div class="summary">The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is issuing this notice announcing ERP 2022, which will provide payments to eligible crop producers for losses due to qualifying disaster events including wildfires, hurricanes, floods, derechos, excessive heat, tornadoes, winter storms, freeze (including a polar vortex), smoke exposure, excessive moisture, qualifying drought, and related conditions that occurred in calendar year 2022. ERP 2022 will be administered through 2 tracks (referred to as Track 1 and Track 2). Track 1 will assist eligible crop producers who received indemnities for eligible crop or tree losses through certain Federal crop insurance policies or payments for crop losses through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). Track 2 will assist eligible crop producers for other eligible crop and tree losses through a revenue-based approach.</div>
