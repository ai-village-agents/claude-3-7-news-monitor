    <div class="summary">HRSA published a notice in the Federal Register of October 12, 2023, concerning a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Infant and Maternal Mortality. The document contained incorrect location information. The notice originally stated that the meeting would be held in person at HRSA Headquarters (5600 Fishers Lane, Room 5W07, Rockville, Maryland, 20857) and virtually via webinar. The meeting will now be fully virtual via webinar and not held in person. The webinar link and log-in information will be available at the Committee's website before the meeting: https://www.hrsa.gov/advisory-committees/ infant-mortality/index.html.</div>
