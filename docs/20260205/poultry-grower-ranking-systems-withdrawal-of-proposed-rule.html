    <h1>Poultry Grower Ranking Systems; Withdrawal of Proposed Rule</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:05</div>
    <div class="summary">The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is withdrawing a proposed rule published in the Federal Register on December 20, 2016. The proposed rule would have identified criteria that the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) could consider when determining whether a live poultry dealer's use of a system for ranking poultry growers for settlement purposes is unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive or gives an undue or unreasonable preference, advantage, prejudice, or disadvantage. Proposed amendments would also have clarified that, absent demonstration of a legitimate business justification, failing to use a poultry grower ranking system in a fair manner after applying the identified criteria is unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive and a violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act, regardless of whether it harms or is likely to harm competition. The Secretary has determined to withdraw the 2016 proposed rule and develop revised proposals pertaining to poultry grower ranking systems.</div>
