    <h1>Updating Regulations for Engineering and Design Materials for Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities Related to Potential Impacts Caused by Natural Hazards</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:46</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) proposes to revise its regulations governing liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities subject to sections 3 and 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) by removing outdated references for seismic hazard evaluations and seismic design criteria for LNG facilities. In their place, the Commission proposes to codify its existing practice of evaluating seismic and other natural hazards and design criteria for LNG facilities under its jurisdiction. These revisions are intended to reduce confusion about applicable technical requirements and clarify the information required in applications filed before the Commission to ensure the public is protected from potential catastrophic impacts caused by natural hazards.</div>
