    <h1>Deadline Extension for Regional Roundtable Discussions Regarding “Waters of the United States”</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:37</div>
    <div class="summary">On October 13, 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of the Army (hereafter, "the agencies") signed a Federal Register publication and publicly announced a process for stakeholders to submit nomination letters with a slate of participants to potentially be selected as one of ten geographically focused roundtables to provide input on the regional implications of "waters of the United States" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act. The intent for each regional roundtable is to engage individuals representing diverse perspectives in meaningful dialogue on the definition of "waters of the United States." This Federal Register document was published on October 25, 2021. In response to robust interest in these roundtables, the agencies are extending the deadline for nominations to be submitted to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on December 1, 2021. In addition, the agencies are providing certain clarifications regarding the nomination process.</div>
