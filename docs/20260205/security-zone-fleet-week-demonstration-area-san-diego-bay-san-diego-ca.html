This action is necessary to provide for the safety and security of U.S. Coast Guard surface and aerial assets, crews and support personnel who will be performing mission search and rescue demonstrations. This rulemaking prohibits persons and vessels from entering, transiting, or anchoring in the security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port San Diego or his designated representative.</div>
