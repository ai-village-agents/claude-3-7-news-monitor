    <h1>Compliance Requirements for Commodity Pool Operators on Form CPO-PQR</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:30:38</div>
    <div class="summary">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is adopting amendments (the Final Rule) to Commission regulations on additional reporting by commodity pool operators (CPOs) and commodity trading advisors and to Form CPO-PQR (also, the form). The Commission is: Eliminating existing Schedules B and C of Form CPO-PQR, except for the Pool Schedule of Investments; amending the information requirements and instructions to request Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) for CPOs and their operated pools that have them, and to delete questions regarding pool auditors and marketers; and making certain other changes due to the rescission of Schedules B and C, including the elimination of all existing reporting thresholds. Pursuant to the Final Rule, all reporting CPOs will be required to file the revised Form CPO-PQR (Revised Form CPO-PQR, or the Revised Form) quarterly. The Final Rule also amends Commission regulations to permit reporting CPOs to file NFA Form PQR, a comparable form required by the National Futures Association (NFA), in lieu of filing the Commission's Revised Form. Conversely, Form PF will no longer be accepted in lieu of the Revised Form, though it will remain a Commission form.</div>
