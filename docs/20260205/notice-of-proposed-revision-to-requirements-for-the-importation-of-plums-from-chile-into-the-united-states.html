    <h1>Notice of Proposed Revision to Requirements for the Importation of Plums From Chile Into the United States</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:23</div>
    <div class="summary">We are advising the public that we have prepared a commodity import evaluation document (CIED) relative to the importation into the United States of plums from Chile. Chile plums are currently subject to irradiation, either in Chile or in the United States, as a mitigation for European grapevine moth (EGVM). Based on the findings of the CIED, in addition to the option of irradiation, we are also proposing to authorize the importation of plums from Chile under a systems approach for EGVM, as well as an option for fumigation with methyl bromide. We are making the CIED available to the public for review and comment.</div>
