This notice also serves as the published guidance establishing the 60-day period described in those provisions of the Code with respect to the applicability of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Finally, this notice provides guidance for determining the beginning of construction of a facility for certain credits allowed under the Code, and the beginning of installation of certain property with respect to the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction under the Code. This notice affects facilities the construction of which began, or certain property the installation of which began, on or after January 30, 2023. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the IRS anticipate issuing proposed regulations and other guidance with respect to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.</div>
