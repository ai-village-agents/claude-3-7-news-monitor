    <div class="summary">The US. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) proposes to revise four and rescind one of its existing internal systems of records under the Privacy Act. The system of records to be rescinded is OGE/INTERNAL-2, which covers telephone call detail records that were used to verify employee telephone usage and to resolve billing discrepancies. The four systems of records to be revised are the following: <bullet> OGE/INTERNAL-1 Pay, Leave and Travel Records, which contains records related to OGE employees' pay, leave, and travel, including information regarding leave accrual rate, usage, and balances, salary withholdings, travel expenses, and usage of the transit fare subsidy program; <bullet> OGE/INTERNAL-3 Grievance Records, which contains records relating to grievances filed by OGE employees; <bullet> OGE/INTERNAL-4 Computer Systems Activity and Access Records, which contains information on the use of official email systems, user access to OGE's computer networks, and records related to the verification or authorization of an individual's access to systems, files, or applications; and <bullet> OGE/INTERNAL-5 Employee Locator and Emergency Notification Records, which contains information regarding the organizational location, telephone extension, and hours of duty of OGE employees, as well as their personal contact information and the name, relationship, and telephone number of employees' emergency contacts.</div>
