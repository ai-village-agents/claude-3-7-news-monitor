    <div class="summary">In this document, the Wireline Competition Bureau of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment on petitions for reconsideration of the RIF Remand Order filed by Common Cause, et al.; INCOMPAS; Public Knowledge; and the County of Santa Clara, et al. The petitioners request that Commission reconsider its decision in the RIF Remand Order, reverse or vacate that Order, and initiate a rulemaking proceeding to address the concerns raised by the D.C. Court of Appeals pertaining to the Commission's 2018 RIF Order. In addition to the issues raised in the petitions, the Commission invites comment on how the issues under consideration in WC Docket No. 23-320 bear on this proceeding.</div>
