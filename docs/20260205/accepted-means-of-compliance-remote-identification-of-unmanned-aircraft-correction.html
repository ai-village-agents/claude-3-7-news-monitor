    <h1>Accepted Means of Compliance; Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft; Correction</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:40</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is correcting a notice of availability (NOA) published on August 11, 2022 (87 FR 49520). In that NOA, the FAA provided an acceptable means of compliance (MOC) in accordance with a rule issued by the FAA on January 21, 2021, that went into effect on April 21, 2021. In that NOA, the FAA accepted ASTM International (ASTM) F3586-22, with additions identified, as an acceptable means, but not the only means of demonstrating compliance with the requirements for producing standard remote identification unmanned aircraft and remote identification broadcast modules. The FAA is correcting the means of compliance of ASTM F3586-22 by correcting a typographical reference error in Table 3 and clarifying a testing requirement by revising a heading and adding clarifying language, as noted in the "Means of Compliance Accepted In This Policy" section of this document. This document includes acceptance of previously accepted MOCs with the corrections described.</div>
