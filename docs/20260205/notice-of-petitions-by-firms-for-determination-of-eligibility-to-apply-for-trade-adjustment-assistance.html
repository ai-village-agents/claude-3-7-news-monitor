    <h1>Notice of Petitions by Firms for Determination of Eligibility To Apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:01:21</div>
    <div class="summary">The Economic Development Administration (EDA) has received petitions for certification of eligibility to apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance from the firms listed below. Accordingly, EDA has initiated investigations to determine whether increased imports into the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each of the firms contributed importantly to the total or partial separation of the firms' workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of each petitioning firm.</div>
