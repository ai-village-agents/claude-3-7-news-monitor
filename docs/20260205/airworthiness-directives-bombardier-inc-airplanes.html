    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc. Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:02</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-1A11 (600), CL-600-2A12 (601), and CL-600-2B16 (601-3A, 601-3R, and 604 Variants) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that, due to a lack of flightcrew awareness, smoke hoods with a certain part number installed throughout the airplane could be mistaken for protective breathing equipment (PBE). This proposed AD would require an inspection or records review to determine if any smoke hood with a certain part number is installed in any location on the airplane and, depending on the results, removing the smoke hood and associated placards and installing new placards. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
