    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier Inc. Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:27:54</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bombardier Inc. Model BD-100-1A10 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a steering control unit (SCU) filter plate connector that does not meet the certification requirements for exposure of electronic components to high intensity radiated field environments, which could result in malfunction of the nose wheel steering (NWS) system. This proposed AD would require determining if the SCU is an affected SCU, replacing all affected SCUs, and rigging and testing the NWS control. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing an affected SCU on any airplane. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
