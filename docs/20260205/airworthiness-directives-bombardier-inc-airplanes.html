    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier, Inc., Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:47:45</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bombardier, Inc., Model CL-600-2B16 (604 Variant) airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports from the supplier that sensing elements of the bleed air leak detection system were manufactured with insufficient salt fill, which can result in an inability to detect hot bleed air leaks. This AD requires testing of all affected overheat detection sensing elements of the bleed air leak detection system, and replacement if necessary. This AD also prohibits the installation of affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
