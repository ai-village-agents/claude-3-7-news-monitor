    <h1>Using Relative Supersaturation To Support “Urinary Tract Health” Claims for Adult Maintenance Cat Food; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:47:49</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry #284 entitled "Using Relative Supersaturation to Support "Urinary Tract Health" Claims for Adult Maintenance Cat Food." FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has evaluated the use of relative supersaturation (RSS) methodology to support urinary tract health claims for certain adult maintenance cat food. RSS is a measurement that estimates the potential for crystal formation and bladder stone growth, which is a common affliction in cats. This draft guidance provides recommendations for how pet food manufacturers can use RSS methodology to substantiate general structure or function claims that an adult maintenance cat food supports urinary tract health by promoting a healthy mineral content in the urinary tract.</div>
