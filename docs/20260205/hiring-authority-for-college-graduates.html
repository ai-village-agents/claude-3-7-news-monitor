    <h1>Hiring Authority for College Graduates</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:36</div>
    <div class="summary">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing an interim rule, with an opportunity for comment, to amend its career and career- conditional employment regulations. The revision is necessary to implement the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, which requires OPM to issue regulations, in interim final form, establishing hiring authorities for college graduates into positions at specified grades in the competitive service. The intended effect of the authority is to provide additional flexibility in hiring eligible and qualified individuals.</div>
