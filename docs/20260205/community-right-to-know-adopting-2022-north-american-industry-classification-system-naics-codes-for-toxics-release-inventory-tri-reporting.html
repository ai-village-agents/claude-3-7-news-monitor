    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:43</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing updates to the list of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes subject to reporting under the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) to reflect the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 2022 NAICS code revision. OMB updates the NAICS codes every five years. EPA is implementing the 2022 codes for TRI Reporting Year 2022 (i.e., facilities reporting to TRI are required to use 2022 NAICS codes on reports that are due to the Agency by July 1, 2023). The actual data required by a TRI form does not change as a result of this rulemaking, nor does the rule affect the universe of TRI reporting facilities that are required to submit reports to the Agency under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).</div>
