    <h1>Special Local Regulations; Recurring Marine Events Within the Fifth Coast Guard District</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:37</div>
    <div class="summary">The Coast Guard is amending its special local regulations established for recurring marine events that take place within the Fifth Coast Guard District area of responsibility. The Coast Guard has periodically updated this regulation to account for changes in these marine events. Through this final rule, the current list of recurring marine events requiring special local regulations is updated with revisions, additional events, and the removal of events that no longer take place in the Fifth Coast Guard District area of responsibility. When these special local regulations are enforced, certain restrictions are placed on marine traffic in specified areas to promote safety on the water around marine events.</div>
