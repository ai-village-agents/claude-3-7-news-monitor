The settlement provides that settling Parties will transfer certain mining claims to purchaser, which will in turn support purchaser's efforts to preserve the important historical structures on these mining claims. The Parties acknowledge that this settlement is structured to support purchaser's efforts to stabilize and preserve the historical structures. In exchange, this settlement resolves the settling Parties' alleged civil liability for the site. In exchange, this settlement also resolves purchaser's potential CERCLA liability.</div>
