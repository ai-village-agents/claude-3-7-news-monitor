    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:37</div>
    <div class="summary">This action proposes to amend 11 low altitude United States Area Navigation (RNAV) T-routes, and remove 1 T-route, in support of the South-Central FL Metroplex Project. The proposed route changes would expand the availability of RNAV routing in support of transitioning the National Airspace System (NAS) from ground-based to satellite-based navigation.</div>
