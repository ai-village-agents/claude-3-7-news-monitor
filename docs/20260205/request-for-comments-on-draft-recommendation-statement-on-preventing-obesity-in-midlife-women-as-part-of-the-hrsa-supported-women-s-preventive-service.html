    <h1>Request for Comments on Draft Recommendation Statement on Preventing Obesity in Midlife Women, as Part of the HRSA-Supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:41</div>
    <div class="summary">This notice seeks public comments on a draft recommendation statement on preventing obesity in midlife women, as part of the HRSA- supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines ("Guidelines"), through a national cooperative agreement, the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI). The WPSI recommends counseling midlife women, aged 40 to 60 years, with normal or overweight BMI (18.5-29.9 kg/m2) to maintain weight or limit weight gain to prevent obesity. Counseling may include individualized discussion of healthy eating and physical activity. Under Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, as added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, non- grandfathered group health plans and non-grandfathered group and individual health insurance issuers must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services under that section, including those provided for in the Guidelines.</div>
