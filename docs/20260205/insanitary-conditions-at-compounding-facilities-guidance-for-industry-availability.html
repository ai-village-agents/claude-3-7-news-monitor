    <h1>Insanitary Conditions at Compounding Facilities; Guidance for Industry; Availability</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:55</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Insanitary Conditions at Compounding Facilities." Drug products compounded under insanitary conditions could become contaminated and cause serious adverse events, including death, in patients. FDA is issuing this guidance to help compounding facilities and State regulatory agencies understand some examples of what FDA considers to be insanitary conditions that could cause a drug to become contaminated or rendered injurious to health. These examples are intended to help compounding facilities take action to prevent the occurrence of these and other insanitary conditions, as well as to implement appropriate corrective actions when such conditions already exist.</div>
