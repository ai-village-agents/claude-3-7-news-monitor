    <h1>Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA) for the Organic and Transitional Education and Certification Program (OTECP)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:50</div>
    <div class="summary">The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is announcing the availability of $20 million through the new Organic and Transitional Education and Certification Program (OTECP) for certified operations and transitional operations that incurred eligible expenses in fiscal years (FY) 2020, 2021, and 2022. Producers and handlers incur significant costs to obtain or renew USDA organic certification each year, and the economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic have made obtaining and renewing USDA organic certification financially challenging for many operations. In this document, FSA is providing the eligibility requirements, application process, and payment calculation for OTECP.</div>
