    <h1>Proposed Information Collection Activity; Survey on Where Parents Look for and Find Information and How They Use Information When Selecting Child Care (New Collection)</h1>

    <div class="summary">The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is proposing to collect nationally representative survey data to learn more about where parents look for and find information about Child Care and Early Education (CCEE); how parents assess the people, places, or things that may offer CCEE information; what types of CCEE information parents look for; and how parents use information to select CCEE. The study aims to gather information that may be used by Child Care Lead Agencies to inform their consumer education efforts.</div>
