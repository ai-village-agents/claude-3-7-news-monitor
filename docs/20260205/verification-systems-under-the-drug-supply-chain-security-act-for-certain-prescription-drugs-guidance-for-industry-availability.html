    <h1>Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs; Guidance for Industry; Availability</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:51</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs." The guidance addresses the verification systems that manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers must have in place to comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as amended by the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Specifically, the guidance covers the statutory verification systems requirements that include the quarantine and investigation of a product determined to be suspect and the quarantine and disposition of a product determined to be illegitimate. The guidance also addresses the statutory requirement for notification to the Agency of a product that has been cleared by a manufacturer, repackager, wholesale distributor, or dispenser (also referred to as "trading partners") after a suspect product investigation because it is determined that the product is not an illegitimate product. Finally, the guidance addresses the statutory requirement for responding to requests for verification and processing saleable returns. The guidance finalizes the revised draft guidance "Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs," issued on March 10, 2022.</div>
