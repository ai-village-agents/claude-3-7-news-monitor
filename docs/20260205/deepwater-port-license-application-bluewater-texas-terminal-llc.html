    <div class="summary">The Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) announce the availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Bluewater Texas Terminal SPM (Bluewater) Deepwater Port License Application for the export of crude oil from the United States to nations abroad. Additionally, MARAD and USCG announce a virtual public meeting and informational open house website for the Bluewater DEIS. Publication of this notice announces availability of the DEIS, initiates a 45-day comment period, requests public participation in the environmental impact review process, provides information on how to participate in the environmental impact review process, and announces the virtual informational open house and public meeting that will take place online to best comply with Coronavirus Disease 2019 safety guidelines. Previously, a notice of application summarizing the original Bluewater Deepwater Port License Application was published June 26, 2019, and notices of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement and public meeting were published on July 3, 2019.</div>
