The collection involves information necessary to submit a Means of Compliance or Declaration of Compliance for Unmanned Aircraft with Remote Identification to the FAA. The collection also involves information necessary to label Unmanned Aircraft that have an FAA- accepted Declaration of Compliance. The information to be collected will be used by the FAA to determine compliance with the requirements for submission of a Means of Compliance or Declaration of Compliance, as well as determine compliance with the Unmanned Aircraft labeling requirements.</div>
