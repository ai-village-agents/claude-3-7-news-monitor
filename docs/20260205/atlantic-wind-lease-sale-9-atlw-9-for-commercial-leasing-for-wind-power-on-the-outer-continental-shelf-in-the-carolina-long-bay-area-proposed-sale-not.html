    <h1>Atlantic Wind Lease Sale 9 (ATLW-9) for Commercial Leasing for Wind Power on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Carolina Long Bay Area-Proposed Sale Notice</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:48</div>
    <div class="summary">This document is the proposed sale notice (PSN) for the sale of a commercial wind energy lease on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Carolina Long Bay area offshore North Carolina (Lease Area). The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) proposes to offer a single lease using a multiple-factor bidding auction format. The PSN contains information pertaining to the areas available for leasing, certain provisions and conditions of the lease, auction details, lease forms, criteria for evaluating competing bids, award procedures, appeal procedures, and lease execution procedures. The issuance of a lease resulting from this sale, if any, would not constitute an approval of project-specific plans to develop offshore wind energy. Such plans, if submitted by the lessee, would be subject to subsequent environmental, technical, and public reviews prior to a decision on whether the proposed development should be authorized.</div>
