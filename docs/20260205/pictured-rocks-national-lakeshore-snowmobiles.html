    <h1>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore; Snowmobiles</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:46</div>
    <div class="summary">The National Park Service proposes to amend its special regulations for Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore to clarify where snowmobiles may be used within the boundaries of the Lakeshore by naming several snowmobile routes that are not currently identified. The proposed rule would replace general language allowing snowmobiles on unplowed roads and the shoulders of plowed roads with a comprehensive list of designated snowmobile routes. The proposed changes would provide greater certainty to the public by removing ambiguity in the current regulations about where snowmobiles are allowed. The use of snowmobiles within areas of the National Park System is prohibited except on routes and water surfaces designated by special regulation.</div>
