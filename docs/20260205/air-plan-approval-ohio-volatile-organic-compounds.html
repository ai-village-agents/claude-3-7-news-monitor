    <h1>Air Plan Approval; Ohio; Volatile Organic Compounds</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:04</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving under the Clean Air Act, a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). This SIP revision request, submitted on April 5, 2019, and supplemented on November 21, 2019, consists of amendments and additions to the volatile organic compound (VOC) rules in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC). These changes provide clarity to facilities that are subject to multiple VOC requirements in the SIP, or whose applicable requirements have been moved to other sections within the OAC as a result of a previous revision. The changes also correct errors and provide general administrative cleanup. An alternative monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting program was added to the requirements for the BP-Husky Refining LLC, Toledo Refinery. In addition, the SIP submittal adds a mechanism for Ohio to approve alternate limitations for site-specific miscellaneous industrial adhesive and sealant facilities and includes alternate site-specific limitations for certain process lines at the Accel Group, Incorporated (Accel) facility in Wadsworth, Ohio. EPA proposed to approve this action on July 22, 2020, and received no adverse comments.</div>
