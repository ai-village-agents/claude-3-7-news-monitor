    <div class="summary">We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are approving an amendment to the West Virginia regulatory program (the West Virginia program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). West Virginia is submitting a proposed amendment to revise the West Virginia Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (WVSCMRA) by creating a new section relating to the award of attorney fees and costs by the Surface Mine Board. On July 11, 2012, OSMRE on an interim basis, approved statutory amendments (WV-119) to the West Virginia regulatory program under SMCRA. West Virginia revised the WVSCMRA to effect changes concerning the special reclamation tax and apportionment of this tax.</div>
