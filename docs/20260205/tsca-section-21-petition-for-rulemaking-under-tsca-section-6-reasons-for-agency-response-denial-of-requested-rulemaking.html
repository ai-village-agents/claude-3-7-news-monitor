    <h1>TSCA Section 21 Petition for Rulemaking Under TSCA Section 6; Reasons for Agency Response; Denial of Requested Rulemaking</h1>

    <div class="summary">This action announces the availability of EPA's response to a petition received on August 16, 2021, from William D. Bush. The petition requests that EPA determine that the "chemical mixtures contained within cosmetics present an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment," and issue a rule or order under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to "eliminate the hazardous chemicals used in mixtures [in cosmetics]." After careful consideration, EPA has denied the petition for the reasons set forth in this document.</div>
