    <h1>Home Mortgage Disclosure (Regulation C); Correction of Supplementary Information</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:02</div>
    <div class="summary">On April 16, 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued the "Home Mortgage Disclosure (Regulation C)" final rule (HMDA Thresholds Final Rule). The Section-by-Section Analysis in the Supplementary Information to the HMDA Thresholds Final Rule contained several clerical errors regarding the estimated cost savings in annual ongoing costs from various possible closed-end coverage thresholds as compared to the then-current coverage threshold of 25 closed-end mortgage loans. This document corrects those errors.</div>
