    <h1>Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; 2021 Re-Opening of Commercial Harvest for South Atlantic Red Snapper</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:36</div>
    <div class="summary">NMFS announces the reopening of the commercial sector for red snapper in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic through this temporary rule. The most recent commercial landings of red snapper indicate that the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for the 2021 fishing year has not yet been reached. Therefore, NMFS reopens the commercial sector for red snapper in the South Atlantic EEZ for 4 calendar days to allow the commercial ACL to be reached, while minimizing the risk of the commercial ACL being exceeded.</div>
