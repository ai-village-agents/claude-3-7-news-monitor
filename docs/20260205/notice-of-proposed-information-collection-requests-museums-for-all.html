    <div class="summary">The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This pre-clearance consultation program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. The purpose of this notice is to solicit comments concerning an information collection from museums participating in the Museums for All program. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the individual listed below in the ADDRESSES section of this notice.</div>
