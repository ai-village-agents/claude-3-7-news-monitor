    <h1>Certain Passive Optical Network Equipment; Notice of Institution of Investigation</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:48</div>
    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on November 14, 2023, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Optimum Communications Services, Inc. of Jersey City, New Jersey. An amended complaint was filed on November 22, 2023. The complaint, as amended, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain passive optical network equipment by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,558,260 ("the '260 patent") and U.S. Patent No. 7,333,511 ("the '511 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a general exclusion order, or in the alternative a limited exclusion, and a cease and desist order.</div>
