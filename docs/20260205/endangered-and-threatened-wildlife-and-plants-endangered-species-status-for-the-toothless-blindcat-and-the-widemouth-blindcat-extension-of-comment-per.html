    <h1>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Species Status for the Toothless Blindcat and the Widemouth Blindcat; Extension of Comment Period</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:51</div>
    <div class="summary">We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reopening the comment period on our August 22, 2023, proposed rule to list the toothless blindcat (Trogloglanis pattersoni) and widemouth blindcat (Satan eurystomus), two cavefish species from the Edwards Aquifer in Bexar County, Texas, as endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We are reopening the proposed rule's comment period to give all interested parties an additional opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they are already incorporated into the public record and will be fully considered in our final determinations.</div>
