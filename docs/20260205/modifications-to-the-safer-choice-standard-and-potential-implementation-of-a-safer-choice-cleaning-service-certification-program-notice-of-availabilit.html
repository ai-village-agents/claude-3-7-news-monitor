    <h1>Modifications to the Safer Choice Standard and Potential Implementation of a Safer Choice Cleaning Service Certification Program; Notice of Availability, Webinar and Request for Comment</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:40</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on a document that announces several proposed changes to EPA's Safer Choice Standard ("the Standard"), including a name change to the Safer Choice and Design for the Environment (DfE) Standard, an update to the packaging criteria, the addition of a Safer Choice certification for cleaning service providers, a provision allowing for preterm partnership termination under exceptional circumstances, and the addition of several product and functional use class requirements. Safer Choice helps consumers, businesses, and purchasers find products that perform and contain ingredients that are safer for human health and the environment. DfE is a similar program currently used by EPA for the purpose of helping consumers and commercial buyers identify antimicrobial products that meet the health and safety standards of the normal pesticide registration process required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as well as other EPA DfE criteria. The Agency will hold a webinar and is requesting written stakeholder comment on the proposed changes to the Standard.</div>
