    <h1>Notice of Tentative Approval and Opportunity for Public Comment and Public Hearing for Public Water System Supervision Program Revision for Pennsylvania</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:08</div>
    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision Program. Pennsylvania has adopted drinking water regulations for the Ground Water Rule and the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that Pennsylvania's Ground Water Rule and Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule meet all minimum federal requirements, and that these are no less stringent than the corresponding federal regulations. Therefore, EPA has tentatively decided to approve the State program revisions.</div>
