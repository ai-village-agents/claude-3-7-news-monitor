    <h1>Proposed Amendment of the Class D and Class E Airspace and Establishment of Class E Airspace; Niagara Falls and Buffalo, NY</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:09</div>
    <div class="summary">This action proposes to amend the Class D airspace and Class E airspace at Niagara Falls International Airport, Niagara Falls, NY, and amend and establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface at Buffalo, NY. The FAA is proposing this action as the result of airspace reviews due to new instrument procedures being implemented at Buffalo- Lancaster Regional Airport, Lancaster, NY. The names and geographic coordinates of airports and navigational aids would also be updated to coincide with the FAA's aeronautical database.</div>
