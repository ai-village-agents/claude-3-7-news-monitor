    <h1>Pesticides; Petition Seeking Rulemaking for Registration of Neonicotinoid Insecticides and Other Systemic Insecticides; Notice of Availability and Request for Comment</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:10:18</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on a petition received from the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) and the American Bird Conservancy (ABC) requesting that the Agency initiate a rulemaking for neonicotinoid insecticides and other systemic insecticides. PEER and ABC believe the Agency should amend the existing regulations under the Federal Insecticide, Rodenticide, and Fungicide Act (FIFRA) to require all applicants and registrants of neonicotinoid and other systemic insecticides to provide performance (efficacy) data to the Agency in applications for registration and during registration review.</div>
