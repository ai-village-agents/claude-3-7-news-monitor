    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85, issued to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC, for operation of the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2 (Limerick). The amendment would make changes to technical specifications (TS) affecting postulated accidents during cold shutdown and refueling operations and make temporary changes to the Limerick TS related to anticipated transients without scram (ATWS) mitigation systems during power production operation.</div>
