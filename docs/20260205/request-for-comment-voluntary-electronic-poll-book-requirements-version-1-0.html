    <h1>Request for Comment: Voluntary Electronic Poll Book Requirements Version 1.0</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:39</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is publishing Version 1.0 of the Voluntary Electronic Poll Book Requirements (VEPBR v1.0) for public comment. The intent of the VEPBR v1.0 is to improve the functionality, security, and accessibility of electronic poll books used in Federal elections. The VEPBR v1.0 establishes baseline requirements for electronic poll book manufacturers to receive certification through the EAC's Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP). This version replaces the draft version (0.9) utilized during the EAC's Voluntary Electronic Poll Book Pilot Program in 2021-2023. Participation in this program is voluntary.</div>
