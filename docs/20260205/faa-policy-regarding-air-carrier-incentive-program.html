    <h1>FAA Policy Regarding Air Carrier Incentive Program</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:52</div>
    <div class="summary">This policy statement updates FAA policy regarding incentives offered by airport sponsors to air carriers for improved air service. It is longstanding practice for airport operators to offer incentives to air carriers to promote new air service at an airport, including both new air carriers serving the airport and new destinations served. The updated policy statement supersedes the 2010 Air Carrier Incentive Program Guidebook. The policy statement includes general principles to assess whether an airport sponsor's air carrier incentive program (ACIP) complies with the sponsor's FAA grant assurances. It also includes guidance on the permissibility of various specific aspects of an ACIP, as well as ACIP implementation.</div>
