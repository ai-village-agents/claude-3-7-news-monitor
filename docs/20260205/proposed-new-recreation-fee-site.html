    <h1>Proposed New Recreation Fee Site</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:10:17</div>
    <div class="summary">The Superior National Forest is proposing to establish a new recreation fee site. Recreation fee revenues collected at the new recreation fee site would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvement of the site. An analysis of nearby recreation fee sites with similar amenities shows the recreation fee that would be charged at the new recreation fee site is reasonable and typical of similar recreation fee sites in the area.</div>
