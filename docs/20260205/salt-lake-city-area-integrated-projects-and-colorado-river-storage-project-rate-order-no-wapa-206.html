    <div class="summary">The provisional fixed rates for the Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects (SLCA/IP) firm power service and the formula rates for the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) transmission services, ancillary services, sale of surplus products, and joint dispatch transmission service have been confirmed, approved, and placed into effect on an interim basis. The firm power rates under SLCA/IP Firm Power Rate Schedule SLIP-F12 expire December 31, 2023. Western Area Power Administration's (WAPA) CRSP Management Center (CRSP MC) is renewing all SLCA/IP and CRSP rates under one Federal Register notice (FRN), making all rates effective for the same period. These new rates replace existing firm power, transmission, ancillary services, sale of surplus products, and joint dispatch transmission service rates under Rate Orders No. WAPA-190, WAPA-195, and WAPA-199.</div>
