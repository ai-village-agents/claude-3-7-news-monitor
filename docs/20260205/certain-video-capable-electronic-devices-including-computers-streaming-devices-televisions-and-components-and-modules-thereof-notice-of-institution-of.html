The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain video capable electronic devices, including computers, streaming devices, televisions, and components and modules thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,724,818 ("the '818 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 10,536,714 ("the '714 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 11,805,267 ("the '267 patent"), U.S. Patent 8,077,991, ("the '991 patent"), and U.S. Patent No. 8,050,321 ("the '321 patent").
