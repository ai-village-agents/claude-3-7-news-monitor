    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Dassault Aviation Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:18</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-21-19, which applies to certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 900EX airplanes. AD 2020-21-19 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-21-19, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-21-19 and would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate additional new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
