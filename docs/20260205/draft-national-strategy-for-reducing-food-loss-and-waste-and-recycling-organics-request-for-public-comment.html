    <h1>Draft National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics: Request for Public Comment</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:36:01</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have developed the Draft National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics ("draft Strategy") to help prevent the loss and waste of food, where possible, increase recycling of food and other organic materials to support a more circular economy for all, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save households and businesses money, and build cleaner and healthier communities. Individually and collectively, the EPA, USDA and FDA are working toward reducing food loss and waste through their Federal interagency collaboration. This Notice provides the public with an opportunity to share input on the draft Strategy, which identifies the EPA, USDA and FDA actions and asks where they can work collaboratively with each other and partners to reduce food loss and waste and recycle organics. These Federal agencies are seeking public comment from diverse partners across the food system. The EPA, USDA and FDA will consider the comments received on this draft Strategy, finalize it, and begin implementation of the final Strategy in 2024.</div>
