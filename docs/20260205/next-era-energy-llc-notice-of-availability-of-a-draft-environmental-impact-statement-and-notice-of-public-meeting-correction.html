    <div class="summary">On October 4, 2021, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), published a document announcing that a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a project proposed by Next Era Energy Inc (NEER), is available for public review and comment. RUS published the Draft EIS to inform interested parties and the general public about the project proposal and to invite the public to comment on the proposed action addressed in the Draft EIS. Following the publication of the Notice of Availability, the Agency found that a correction due to an error, is necessary. This correction changes the date public comments are due to RUS.</div>
