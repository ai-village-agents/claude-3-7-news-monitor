    <h1>Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Okeechobee Waterway, Stuart, FL</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:35</div>
    <div class="summary">The Coast Guard proposes to modify the operating schedule that governs the Roosevelt (US1) Bridge, across the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.5, at Stuart, FL. This action is necessary to allow the drawbridge to operate on demand as outlined in the Record of Decision for the high-level fixed US1 Roosevelt Bridge which was constructed in 1997. Additionally, with the anticipated increase in railway activity on the adjacent railroad bridge, this proposed modification will allow the bridges to operate in concert. The drawbridge name in the regulation is incorrect and will be changed. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.</div>
