    <div class="summary">The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is soliciting public comment on People's Republic of China (PRC) policies and influence in the development of international standards for emerging technologies. Section 9414 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2021 directs NIST to enter into an agreement with an appropriate entity to conduct a study and provide recommendations with respect to the effect of policies of the PRC and coordination among industrial entities within the PRC on international bodies engaged in developing and setting international standards for emerging technologies. NIST is seeking comments to provide information for the study and resulting recommendations. In addition to the specific topic areas found in the Request for Information section of this notice, commenters may provide responses to any other relevant issues. Recommendations on the actions the United States could take to mitigate any undue influence of the PRC and bolster United States public and private sector participation in international standards- setting bodies are also sought. Comments received in response to this request will be used to inform the work of the entity.</div>
