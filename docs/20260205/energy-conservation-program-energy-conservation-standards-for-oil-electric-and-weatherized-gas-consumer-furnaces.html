    <h1>Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Oil, Electric, and Weatherized Gas Consumer Furnaces</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:30</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") announces the availability of the preliminary analysis it has conducted for purposes of evaluating the need for amended energy conservation standards for non-weatherized oil-fired furnaces ("NWOFs"), mobile home oil-fired furnaces ("MHOFs"), weatherized gas furnaces ("WGFs"), weatherized oil-fired furnaces ("WOFs"), and electric furnaces ("EFs"). The analysis is set forth in the Department's accompanying preliminary technical support document ("TSD") for this rulemaking. DOE will hold a public meeting via webinar to discuss and receive comment on the preliminary analysis. The meeting will cover the analytical framework, models, and tools used to evaluate potential standards; the results of preliminary analyses performed by DOE; the potential energy conservation standard levels derived from these analyses (if DOE determines that proposed amendments are necessary); and other relevant issues. In addition, DOE encourages written comments on these subjects.</div>
