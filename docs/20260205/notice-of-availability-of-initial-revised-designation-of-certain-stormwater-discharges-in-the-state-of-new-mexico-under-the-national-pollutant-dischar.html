    <h1>Notice of Availability of Initial Revised Designation of Certain Stormwater Discharges in the State of New Mexico Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System of the Clean Water Act</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:47:41</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 6 is providing notice of an initial revised designation determination that storm water discharges from the Los Alamos Urban Area (as defined by the latest decennial Census) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) property in Los Alamos County and Santa Fe County, New Mexico are contributing to violations of New Mexico water quality standards (WQS) and require National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit coverage under the Clean Water Act (CWA). This action is in response to a June 30, 2014, petition filed with EPA by Amigos Bravos entitled "A Petition by Amigos Bravos for a Determination that Storm Water Discharges in Los Alamos County Contribute to Water Quality Standards Violations and Require a Clean Water Act Permit," and revises the Agency's prior December 16, 2019, designation decision, which was remanded to EPA for reconsideration by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.</div>
