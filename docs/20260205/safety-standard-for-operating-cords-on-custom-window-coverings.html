    <h1>Safety Standard for Operating Cords on Custom Window Coverings</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:47</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has determined that custom window coverings with accessible operating cords longer than 8 inches pose an unreasonable risk of strangulation to children 8 years old and younger. To address this risk of strangulation, the Commission is issuing a final rule under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) to require that operating cords on custom window coverings meet the same requirements as operating cords on stock window coverings, as set forth in the applicable voluntary standard. The final rule provides several methods to make window covering cords inaccessible or non-hazardous. Because this is a consumer product safety rule, operating cords on custom window coverings must be tested and certified as meeting the requirements of the final rule. Custom window coverings that meet the definition of a "children's product" require third party testing by a CPSC-accepted third party conformity assessment body. Accordingly, the final rule also amends the Commission's regulation that lists children's product rules requiring third party testing.</div>
