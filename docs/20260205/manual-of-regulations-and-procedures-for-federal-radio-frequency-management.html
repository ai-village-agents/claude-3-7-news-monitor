    <div class="summary">The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is making certain changes to its regulations relating to the public availability of the Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management (NTIA Manual). NTIA has the authority, delegated by the president, to assign frequencies to radio stations or classes of radio stations belonging to and operated by the United States. NTIA's manual reflects this authority and provides for the coordination of Executive branch agencies' spectrum management and coordination. Specifically, NTIA is releasing a revised edition of the NTIA Manual, with which Federal agencies must comply when requesting use of radio frequency spectrum.</div>
