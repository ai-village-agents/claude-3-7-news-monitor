    <h1>Prohibitions in Region 8, Southern Region</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:11</div>
    <div class="summary">The Chattooga Wild and Scenic River is located in the Nantahala National Forest in North Carolina, the Sumter National Forest in South Carolina, and the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia. Forest Service regulations generally prohibit floating activities on the Chattooga Wild and Scenic River unless authorized by a permit. On January 31, 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service issued decisions to change some of the locations where, and conditions under which, boating would be allowed. The 2012 decision included segments of the Chattooga Wild and Scenic River in North Carolina, which was not included in the original rule. Consequently, the Forest Service is amending the regulations to reflect the new management direction more accurately for the Chattooga Wild and Scenic River.</div>
