    <h1>VA Veteran Readiness and Employment Program: Removal of Regulation Regarding Repayment of Training and Rehabilitation Supplies</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:36:03</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is removing a regulation that addresses the circumstances under which a Veteran is to repay the value of training and rehabilitation supplies and the exceptions where repayment is not required. A prior version of the regulation's authorizing statute contained a provision that permitted VA to require the return or repayment of books, supplies, or equipment if a Veteran failed to complete a course of vocational rehabilitation due to fault on their part. However, because the authorizing statute no longer contains that provision, and because there is no statutory authority allowing VA to require reimbursement of books, supplies, or equipment under any circumstance where a Veteran fails to complete a course of vocational rehabilitation, VA is removing the governing regulation.</div>
