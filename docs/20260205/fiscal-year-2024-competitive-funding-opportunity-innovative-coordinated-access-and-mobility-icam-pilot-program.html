    <h1>Fiscal Year 2024 Competitive Funding Opportunity: Innovative Coordinated Access and Mobility (ICAM) Pilot Program</h1>

    <div class="summary">The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) announces the opportunity to apply for $4.7 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 funding under the Innovative Coordinated Access and Mobility (ICAM) pilot program. This funding opportunity seeks to improve coordination to enhance access and mobility to vital community services for older adults, people with disabilities, and people of low income. As required by Federal public transportation law, funds will be awarded competitively as grants to finance innovative mobility management capital projects that will improve the coordination of transportation services and Non-Emergency Medical Transportation (NEMT) services. An additional $4.8 million is authorized for FY 2024 and FTA may award additional funding that is made available to the program prior to the announcement of project selections.</div>
