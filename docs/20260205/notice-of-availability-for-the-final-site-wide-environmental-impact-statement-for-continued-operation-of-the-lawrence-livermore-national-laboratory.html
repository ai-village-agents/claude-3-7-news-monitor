    <div class="summary">The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi- autonomous agency within the United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE), announces the availability of a Final Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement for Continued Operation of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Final LLNL SWEIS) (DOE/EIS-0547) in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). NNSA prepared the Final LLNL SWEIS to analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with continuing LLNL operations and foreseeable new and/or modified operations and facilities for approximately the next 15 years. Volume 3 of the Final LLNL SWEIS is a comment response document (CRD), which includes all comments received during the public comment period on the Draft LLNL SWEIS, as well as NNSA's responses to those comments.</div>
