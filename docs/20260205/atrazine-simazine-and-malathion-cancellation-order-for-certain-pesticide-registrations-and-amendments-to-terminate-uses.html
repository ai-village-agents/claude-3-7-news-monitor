    <h1>Atrazine, Simazine, and Malathion; Cancellation Order for Certain Pesticide Registrations and Amendments to Terminate Uses</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:46</div>
    <div class="summary">This notice announces EPA's order for the cancellations and/or amendments to terminate uses, voluntarily requested by the registrants and accepted by the Agency, of the products listed in Tables 1 and 2 of Unit II, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This cancellation/use termination order follows a June 23, 2021 Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Requests from the registrants listed in Table 3 of Unit II to voluntarily cancel their registrations of certain products containing the pesticides atrazine and simazine, and/or to amend their atrazine, simazine, or malathion product registrations to terminate one or more uses. In the June 23, 2021 notice, EPA indicated that it would issue an order implementing the cancellations and/or amendments to terminate uses, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the 30-day comment period that would merit its further review of these requests, or unless the registrants withdrew their requests. The Agency did not receive any comments on the notice. Further, the registrants did not withdraw their requests. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues in this notice a cancellation order granting the requested cancellations and/or amendments to terminate uses. Any distribution, sale, or use of the products subject to this cancellation order is permitted only in accordance with the terms of this order, including any existing stocks provisions.</div>
