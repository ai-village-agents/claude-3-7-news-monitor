    <h1>Fisheries Off West Coast States; Pacific Halibut Fisheries; Permitting and Management Regulations for Area 2A Pacific Halibut Fisheries</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:06</div>
    <div class="summary">Under the authority of the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, this final rule implements a permitting system for the Pacific halibut commercial and recreational charter halibut fisheries in International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) regulatory Area 2A (Washington, Oregon, and California). This action also establishes a regulatory framework for the Area 2A Pacific halibut directed commercial fishery that, consistent with the allocations and coastwide season dates set by the IPHC, allows NMFS to annually determine dates and times the fishery will be open and set harvest limits for those periods of time. These permitting and management activities for Area 2A were previously performed by the IPHC; through this final rule, NMFS will now implement these Area 2A-specific permitting and management activities.</div>
