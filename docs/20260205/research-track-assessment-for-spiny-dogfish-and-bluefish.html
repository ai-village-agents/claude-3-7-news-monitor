    <div class="summary">NMFS will convene the Research Track Assessment Peer Review Meeting for the purpose of reviewing Spiny Dogfish and Bluefish stocks. The Research Track Assessment Peer Review is a formal scientific peer- review process for evaluating and presenting stock assessment results to managers for fish stocks in the offshore U.S. waters of the northwest Atlantic. Assessments are prepared by the research track working group and reviewed by an independent panel of stock assessment experts from the Center of Independent Experts (CIE). The public is invited to attend the presentations and discussions between the review panel and the scientists who have participated in the stock assessment process.</div>
