    <h1>Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; 2023 Commercial Hook-and-Line Closure for Golden Tilefish in the South Atlantic</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:07</div>
    <div class="summary">NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial hook-and-line component of golden tilefish in the South Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS projects that commercial landings of golden tilefish harvested by hook-and-line are projected to reach the commercial component quota in the 2023 fishing year. Accordingly, NMFS closes the commercial hook-and-line component for golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ for the remainder of the 2023 fishing year to protect the golden tilefish resource.</div>
