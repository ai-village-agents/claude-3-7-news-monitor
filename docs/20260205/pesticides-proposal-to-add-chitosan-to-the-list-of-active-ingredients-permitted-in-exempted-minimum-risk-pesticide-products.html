    <h1>Pesticides; Proposal To Add Chitosan to the List of Active Ingredients Permitted in Exempted Minimum Risk Pesticide Products</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:59</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to add the substance commonly referred to as chitosan (also known by its chemical name: poly-D-glucosamine) (CAS Reg. No. 9012-76-4) to the list of active ingredients allowed in minimum risk pesticide products exempt from registration and other requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Tidal Vision Products, LLC submitted a petition to EPA requesting that chitosan be added to both the lists of active and inert ingredients allowed in exempted minimum risk pesticide products. At this time, EPA is deferring a decision on whether to add chitosan to the list of allowable inert ingredients.</div>
