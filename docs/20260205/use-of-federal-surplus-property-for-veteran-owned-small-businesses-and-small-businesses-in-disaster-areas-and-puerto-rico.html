    <div class="summary">The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is amending its regulations to expand access to the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Surplus Personal Property Donation Program for certain small business concerns in accordance with the Recovery Improvements for Small Entities After Disaster Act of 2015 (RISE Act), the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act, and the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA). These Acts provide that small businesses in disaster areas, veteran-owned small businesses, and small business concerns located in Puerto Rico, respectively, should be considered for surplus personal property distributions. SBA, in coordination with GSA, is enacting certain procedures for determining which firms may participate in GSA's existing surplus personal property program, and under what conditions.</div>
