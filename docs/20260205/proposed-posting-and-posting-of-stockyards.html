    <h1>Proposed Posting and Posting of Stockyards</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:26</div>
    <div class="summary">The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is taking action to post stockyards under the Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S Act). Specifically, we are proposing that 15 stockyards now operating subject to the P&S Act be posted. Also, we are posting 10 stockyards that were identified previously as operating subject to the P&S Act. We determined that the stockyards meet the definition of a stockyard under the P&S Act and, therefore, they have been posted.</div>
