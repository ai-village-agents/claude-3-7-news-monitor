    <h1>Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.; Determination of Nonregulated Status for Insect Resistant and Herbicide-Tolerant Maize</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:47:38</div>
    <div class="summary">We are advising the public of our determination that DP23211 maize (corn), which has been developed using genetic engineering for insect resistance to western corn rootworm and contains the gene that codes for the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein responsible for tolerance to glufosinate-ammonium herbicides, and also the gene that encodes for the phosphomannose isomerase protein as a selectable marker, is no longer considered regulated. Our determination is based on our evaluation of information Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. submitted in its petition for a determination of nonregulated status, our analyses, and public comments received in response to previous notices announcing the availability of the petition for nonregulated status and our associated environmental assessment and plant pest risk assessment. This notice also announces the availability of our written determination and finding of no significant impact.</div>
