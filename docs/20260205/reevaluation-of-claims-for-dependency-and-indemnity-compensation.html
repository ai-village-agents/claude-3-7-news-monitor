    <h1>Reevaluation of Claims for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:10:20</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) amends its adjudication regulations concerning certain awards of Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). Under this amendment, relevant claimants will be eligible to elect to have certain previously denied DIC claims reevaluated pursuant to changes that establish or modify a presumption of service connection. Any award as a result of the reevaluation may be made retroactive as if the establishment or modification of the presumption of service connection had been in effect on the date of the submission of the original claim. This amendment incorporates legislative changes enacted by the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 and will bring Federal regulations into conformance with those changes.</div>
