    <h1>Safety Zone; East River, New York, NY</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:59</div>
    <div class="summary">The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for navigable waters of the east channel of the East River between the Roosevelt Island Bridge (mile 6.4) and Gibbs Point approximately 800 yards northeast of the bridge. The safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from potential hazards created by the installation of one TriFrame with three attached underwater turbines, associated cabling and 4 to 6 Private Aids to Navigation. When enforced, entry of vessels or persons into this zone is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port New York.</div>
