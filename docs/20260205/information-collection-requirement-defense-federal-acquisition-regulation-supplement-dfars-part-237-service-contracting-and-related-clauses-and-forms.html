    <h1>Information Collection Requirement; Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Part 237, Service Contracting, and Related Clauses and Forms</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:49</div>
    <div class="summary">In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, DoD announces a proposed extension of a public information collection requirement and seeks public comment on the provisions thereof. DoD invites comments on: Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of DoD, including whether the information will have practical utility; the accuracy of the estimate of the burden of the proposed information collection; ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and ways to minimize the burden of the information collection on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved this information collection requirement for use through February 28, 2022. DoD proposes that OMB extend its approval for three additional years.</div>
