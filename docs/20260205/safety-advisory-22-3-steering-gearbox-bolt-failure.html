    <div class="summary">The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is issuing Safety Advisory 22-3 to recommend that transit agencies identify Nova Bus models manufactured in 2018 or later that use a Bosch steering gearbox affixed to the vehicle frame through a mounting plate and perform inspections, as recommended by Nova Bus. In addition, FTA recommends that any transit agency that identifies buses equipped with this mounting plate assembly submit a summary of their findings to FTA. FTA Safety Advisory 22-3 "Steering Gearbox Bolt Failure" is available in its entirety on FTA's Safety Advisory website: (https:// www.transit.dot.gov/regulations-and-guidance/safety/fta-safety- advisories).</div>
