    <h1>Small Business Size Standards: Calculation of Number of Employees for All Programs and of Average Annual Receipts in the Business Loan, Disaster Loan, and Small Business Investment Company Programs</h1>

    <div class="summary">The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA or Agency) is proposing to use a 24-month average to calculate a business concern's number of employees for eligibility purposes in all of SBA's programs. SBA also proposes to permit business concerns in its Business Loan, Disaster Loan, and Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Programs to use a 5-year averaging period, in addition to the existing 3-year averaging period, for the purposes of calculating annual average receipts. These proposed changes will allow larger small businesses to retain their small business size status for longer, and some mid-sized businesses to regain small business status.</div>
