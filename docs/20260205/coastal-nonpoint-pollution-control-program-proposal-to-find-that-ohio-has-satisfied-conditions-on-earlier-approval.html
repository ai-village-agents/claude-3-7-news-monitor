    <h1>Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program: Proposal To Find That Ohio Has Satisfied Conditions on Earlier Approval</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:19</div>
    <div class="summary">The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (hereafter, "the agencies") invite public comment on the agencies' proposed finding that Ohio has satisfied all conditions the agencies established as part of their 2002 approval of the state's coastal nonpoint pollution control program (coastal nonpoint program). The Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments (CZARA) directs states and territories with coastal zone management programs previously approved under Section 306 of the Coastal Zone Management Act to develop and implement coastal nonpoint programs, which must be submitted to the federal agencies for approval. Prior to making such a finding, NOAA and EPA invite public input on the agencies' rationale for this proposed finding.</div>
