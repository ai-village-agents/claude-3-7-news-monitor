    <div class="summary">The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is seeking persons or governmental agencies interested in providing official services in the areas noted below to submit an application for designation. Designation provides for private entities or State governmental agencies to be an integral part of the official grain inspection system (https:// www.ams.usda.gov/services/fgis/official-grain-inspection-weighing- system). Designated agencies work under the supervision of the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) and are authorized to provide official inspection and weighing services in a defined geographic area, as appropriate. In addition, we request comments on the quality of services provided by designated agency Michigan Grain Inspection Services, Inc. (Michigan Grain Inspection). AMS encourages submissions from traditionally underrepresented individuals, organizations, and businesses to reflect the diversity of this industry. AMS encourages submissions from qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.</div>
