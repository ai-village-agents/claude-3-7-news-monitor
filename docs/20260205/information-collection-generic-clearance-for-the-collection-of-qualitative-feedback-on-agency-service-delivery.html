    <div class="summary">Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, this notice announces that the NTSB's Information Collection Request (ICR) will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. On May 30, 2023, the NTSB published the requisite 60-Day Notice in the Federal Register, notifying the public that the NTSB seeks OMB approval on generic clearance for qualitative feedback on agency service delivery. To date, no comments have been received. However, the NTSB has since corrected a typographical error regarding the estimated average burden hours and has added to the list of the types of collections that this generic clearance covers. The NTSB is now issuing this 30-Day Notice, directing the public to submit all comments to OMB.</div>
