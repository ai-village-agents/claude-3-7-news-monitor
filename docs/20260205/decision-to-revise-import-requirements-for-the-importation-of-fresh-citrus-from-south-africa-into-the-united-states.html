    <h1>Decision To Revise Import Requirements for the Importation of Fresh Citrus From South Africa Into the United States</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:54</div>
    <div class="summary">We are advising the public of our decision to revise the import requirements for citrus (grapefruit, lemon, mandarin orange, sweet orange, tangelo, and Satsuma mandarin) fruit from South Africa into the United States. Based on the findings of a commodity import evaluation document (CIED), which we made available to the public for review and comment through a previous notice, we are removing restrictions on the ports of entry into which such citrus may be imported. This action will allow these citrus species to be imported into more ports in the United States without presenting a risk of introduction or dissemination of plant pests or noxious weeds.</div>
