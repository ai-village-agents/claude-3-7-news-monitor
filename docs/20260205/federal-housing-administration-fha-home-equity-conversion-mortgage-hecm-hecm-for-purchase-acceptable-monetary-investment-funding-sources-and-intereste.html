    <div class="summary">The Department of the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a notice in the Federal Register of October 24, 2023, to inform members of the public and affected program participants of changes to the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) for Purchase program that HUD intends to make in a future update to HUD's Single Family Housing Policy Handbook. The notice provided an opportunity for public comment but did not include the necessary language to allow for submission of comment in the Federal Register. This notice corrects this error and extends the public comment period to allow thirty days to submit comments through the Federal Register.</div>
