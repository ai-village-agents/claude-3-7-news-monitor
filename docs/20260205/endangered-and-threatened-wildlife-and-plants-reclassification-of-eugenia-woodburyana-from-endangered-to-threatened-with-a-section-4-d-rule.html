    <h1>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reclassification of Eugenia woodburyana From Endangered to Threatened With a Section 4(d) Rule</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:14</div>
    <div class="summary">We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reclassifying (downlisting) the plant Eugenia woodburyana (no common name) from an endangered species to a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), due to improvements in the species' status since its original listing in 1994. This action is based on a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that E. woodburyana is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, but it is likely to become so within the foreseeable future. We are also finalizing a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act to provide measures that are necessary and advisable for the conservation of E. woodburyana.</div>
