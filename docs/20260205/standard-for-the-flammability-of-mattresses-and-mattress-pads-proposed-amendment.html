    <h1>Standard for the Flammability of Mattresses and Mattress Pads; Proposed Amendment</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:11</div>
    <div class="summary">The Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission, or CPSC) is proposing to amend its Standard for the Flammability of Mattresses and Mattress Pads. The ignition source cigarette specified in the standard for use in the mattress standard's performance tests, Standard Reference Material cigarette SRM 1196, is no longer available for purchase. The Commission is proposing to amend the mattress standard to require a revised Standard Reference Material cigarette, SRM 1196a, which was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as the ignition source for testing to the mattress standard.</div>
