    <h1>Suspicious Orders of Controlled Substances</h1>

    <div class="summary">The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is proposing to revise its regulations relating to suspicious orders of controlled substances, in order to implement the Preventing Drug Diversion Act of 2018 (PDDA) and to clarify the procedures a registrant must follow for orders received under suspicious circumstances (ORUSCs). Upon receipt of an ORUSC, registrants authorized to distribute controlled substances would have a choice of proceeding under one of two options (the "two option framework"). In addition, these registrants would be required to submit all suspicious order reports to a DEA centralized database, and keep records pertaining to suspicious orders and ORUSCs.</div>
