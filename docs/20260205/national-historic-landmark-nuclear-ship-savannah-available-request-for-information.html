    <div class="summary">The Maritime Administration (MARAD) is decommissioning the nuclear power plant of the National Historic Landmark (NHL) vessel Nuclear Ship Savannah (NSS), which will result in the termination of the ship's Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license, making the ship available for disposition, including potential conveyance or preservation. The purpose of the Notice of Availability and Request for Information (NOA and RFI) is to determine preservation interest from entities that may wish to acquire the NSS. Information received in response to this RFI will help to inform the development of viable preservation alternatives for the NSS. MARAD requests information from entities that may be interested in acquiring the ship for conveyance and preservation purposes as prescribed in the recently executed Programmatic Agreement (PA) which is available for review on the MARAD docket at www.regulations.gov. In responding to the RFI, please review the below SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION/Information Requested section to inform your submission.</div>
