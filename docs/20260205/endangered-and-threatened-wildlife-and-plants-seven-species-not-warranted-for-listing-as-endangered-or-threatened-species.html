    <h1>Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Seven Species Not Warranted for Listing as Endangered or Threatened Species</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:48:01</div>
    <div class="summary">We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce findings that seven species are not warranted for listing as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list Edison's ascyrum (Hypericum edisonianum), Florida (lowland) loosestrife (Lythrum flagellare), Florida pinesnake (Pituophis melanoleucus mugitu), mimic cavesnail (Phreatodrobia imitata), northern cavefish (Amblyopsis spelaea), smallscale darter (Etheostoma microlepidum), and Texas troglobitic water slater (Lirceolus smithii). However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information relevant to the status of any of the species mentioned above or their habitats.</div>
