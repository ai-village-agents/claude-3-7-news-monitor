    <div class="summary">Southeastern Power Administration (Southeastern or SEPA) announces revision to the power marketing policy for the Cumberland System of Projects to include a procedure for distribution of renewable energy certificates (RECs).

Pursuant to the Procedure for Public Participation in the Formulation of Marketing Policy, published in the Federal Register on July 6, 1978, Southeastern published on October 21, 2021, a notice of intent to revise the power marketing policy to include provisions regarding RECs from the Cumberland System. The proposed revision to the Cumberland System Power Marketing Policy was published in the Federal Register on April 25, 2023. A virtual web based public information and comment forum was held on June 29, 2023, with written comments due on or before July 14, 2023.</div>
