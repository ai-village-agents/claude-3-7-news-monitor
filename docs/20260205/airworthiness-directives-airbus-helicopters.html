    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Helicopters</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:30:39</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-19-01, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, EC155B1, SA-365N1, and SA-366G1 helicopters. AD 2018- 19-01 requires repetitive inspections of the aft fuselage outer skin. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-19-01, it was determined that Model SA- 365N helicopters are also affected by the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require repetitive inspections and would add Model SA-365N helicopters, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
