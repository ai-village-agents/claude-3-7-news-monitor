    <h1>Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions</h1>

    <div class="summary">The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2023. The annual indexation of these amounts is required notwithstanding the Board's action in March 2020 of setting all reserve requirement ratios to zero. The Regulation D amendments set the reserve requirement exemption amount for 2023 at $36.1 million (increased from $32.4 million in 2022) and the amount of the low reserve tranche at $691.7 million (increased from $640.6 million in 2022). The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act (the "Act"). The annual indexation of the reserve requirement exemption amount and low reserve tranche, though required by statute, will not affect depository institutions' reserve requirements, which will remain zero.</div>
