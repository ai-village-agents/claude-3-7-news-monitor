    <h1>Security Zone; San Juan, Puerto Rico</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:59</div>
    <div class="summary">The Coast Guard is proposing to revise an existing moving security zone for the Port of San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The proposed revision would expand the existing moving security zone to a 200-yard radius around all cruise ships entering, departing, or anchored in the Port of San Juan. While the cruise ships are moored at the Port of San Juan, the security zone would remain at a 50-yard radius around the cruise ships. This action would continue to prohibit persons and vessels from entering, anchoring, mooring or transiting in the security zone, unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port of San Juan or a designated representative. This action is necessary to better meet the safety and security needs of the Port of San Juan. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.</div>
