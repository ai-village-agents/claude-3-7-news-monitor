    <h1>Wireless Telecommunication Bureau Seeks To Supplement the Record on 70/80/90 GHz Bands Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:30</div>
    <div class="summary">In this document, the Commission seeks comment to supplement the record in the rulemaking on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to address the potential for use of the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, 92-94 GHz, and the 94.1-95 GHz (70/80/90 GHz) bands to provide broadband internet access to consumers and communities that may otherwise lack robust, consistent connectivity. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) or other stratospheric- based platform services could be deployed for this purpose in the 70/ 80/90 GHz bands. The Commission also seeks additional information regarding the potential use of these bands to provide broadband internet access to customers on airplanes and aboard ships, as proposed by Aeronet Global Communications, Inc.</div>
