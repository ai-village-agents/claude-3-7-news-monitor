    <h1>Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; 2020 Commercial Closure for Atlantic Migratory Group Cobia</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:09</div>
    <div class="summary">NMFS implements a closure for Atlantic migratory group cobia (Atlantic cobia) that are sold (commercial) and harvested from Atlantic Federal waters off Georgia through New York. NMFS projects that commercial landings of Atlantic cobia will reach the commercial quota on November 6, 2020. Therefore, NMFS closes the commercial sector for Atlantic cobia in Federal waters from November 6, 2020, until the start of the next fishing year on January 1, 2021. This closure is necessary to protect the Atlantic cobia resource.</div>
