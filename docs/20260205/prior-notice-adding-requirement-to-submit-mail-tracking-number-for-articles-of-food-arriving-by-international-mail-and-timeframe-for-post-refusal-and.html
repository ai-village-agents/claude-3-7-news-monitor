    <h1>Prior Notice: Adding Requirement To Submit Mail Tracking Number for Articles of Food Arriving by International Mail and Timeframe for Post-Refusal and Post-Hold Submissions</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:49</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing to amend its prior notice regulations to add a requirement that the prior notice for articles of food arriving by international mail include the name of the mail service and a mail tracking number and add a requirement that prior notice and food facility registration information be submitted within a certain timeframe, after certain notices of refusal or hold have been issued ("post-refusal" and "post-hold" submission). We are also proposing certain technical changes, including those that reflect expanded capabilities of the Automated Broker Interface/Automated Commercial Environment/ International Trade Data System (ABI/ACE/ITDS) and the Prior Notice Systems Interface (PNSI). These amendments, if finalized, will improve program efficiency and better enable FDA to protect the U.S. food supply and public health.</div>
