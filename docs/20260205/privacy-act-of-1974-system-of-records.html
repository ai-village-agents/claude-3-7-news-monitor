    <div class="summary">FMC-40 The Service Contract Filing System (SERVCON) is the Federal Maritime Commission's (Commission's) automated filing system for service contracts. Shippers or vessel-operating common carriers (VOCCs) are required to file service contracts with the Commission on form FMC-83. This system is not being discontinued, however, SERVCON does not meet the requirements of a Privacy Act System of Records as it does not maintain "records" as defined under the Privacy Act (PA), that are "about" an individual.</div>
