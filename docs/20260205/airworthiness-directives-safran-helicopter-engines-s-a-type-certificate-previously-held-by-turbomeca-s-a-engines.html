    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Turbomeca, S.A.) Engines</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:18:54</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-08-02 for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) (type certificate previously held by Turbomeca, S.A.) Model Arriel 2D and Arriel 2E engines. AD 2021-08-02 required replacing certain critical parts before reaching their published in-service life limits, performing scheduled maintenance tasks before reaching their published periodicity, and performing unscheduled maintenance tasks when the engine meets certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-08-02, Safran has revised the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the existing maintenance and overhaul manuals, introducing new and more restrictive instructions and maintenance tasks, which prompted this AD action. This AD requires updating the ALS of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, by incorporating the actions and associated thresholds and intervals, including life limits, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
