    <h1>Biannual Request for Information on the Status of the Electric Vehicle (EV) Charger Industry</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:02</div>
    <div class="summary">On February 21, 2023, FHWA established a Build America, Buy America (BABA) implementation plan by publishing a temporary public interest waiver of Buy America requirements for steel, iron, manufactured products, and construction materials in electric vehicle (EV) chargers. This short-term, temporary waiver was structured to enable EV charger acquisition and installation to immediately proceed while also ensuring the application of Buy America to EV chargers by the phasing out of the waiver over time. While promulgating the final waiver, FHWA announced that it would conduct biannual RFIs to receive information on the status of the EV charger industry. Requests for comment include, but are not limited to, the number of chargers recently produced by EV charger manufacturers, projections on chargers expected to be produced, and the number of EV chargers recently purchased by recipients of Federal financial assistance and projected to be purchased by recipients of Federal financial assistance in the near future.</div>
