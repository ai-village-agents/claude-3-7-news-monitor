    <div class="summary">This final rule amends the regulations under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (Act), to add disclosures and information that live poultry dealers engaged in the production of broilers must furnish to poultry growers with whom dealers make poultry growing arrangements. The rule also establishes additional disclosure requirements for live poultry dealers engaged in the production of broilers who use poultry grower ranking systems to determine settlement payments for broiler growers. These requirements add targeted transparency to the market for grower services that will inhibit deceptive practices related to broiler contracting and performance. The Act protects fair trade, financial integrity, and competitive markets for livestock, meat, and poultry.</div>
