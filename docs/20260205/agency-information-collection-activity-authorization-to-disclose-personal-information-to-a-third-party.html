    <div class="summary">Veterans Benefits Administrations, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the proposed collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995, Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of a currently approved collection, and allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This form will be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs Insurance Center (VAIC) to enable a third party to act on behalf of the insured Veteran/beneficiary. Many of our customers are of advanced age or suffer from limiting disabilities and need assistance from a third party to conduct their affairs. The information collected provides an optional service and is not required to receive insurance benefits.</div>
