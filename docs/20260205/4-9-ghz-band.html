    <h1>4.9 GHz Band</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:01:21</div>
    <div class="summary">In March 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) released a Sixth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Sixth FNPRM) seeking comment on ways to stimulate expanded use of and investment in the 4.9 GHz (4940-4990 MHz) band, including allowing licensees the flexibility to engage in spectrum leasing and broadening existing eligibility requirements. On September 8, 2020, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau issued a Public Notice freezing the 4.9 GHz band to stabilize it while the Commission considered changes to the 4.9 GHz band rules (Freeze Public Notice). In this document, the Commission adopts rules permitting one statewide 4.9 GHz band licensee per state, the State Lessor, to lease some or all of its spectrum rights to third parties-- including commercial and public safety users--in those states that the Commission has not identified as a diverter of 911 fees. The Report and Order does not limit or modify the rights of any incumbent public safety licensees. The new rules also eliminate the requirement that leased spectrum must be used to support public safety but requires lessees to adhere to the informal coordination requirements applicable to the band.</div>
