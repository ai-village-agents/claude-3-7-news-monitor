    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on September 27, 2021, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Bell Northern Research, LLC of Chicago, Illinois. A supplement was filed on October 15, 2021. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain electronic devices having wireless communication capabilities and components thereof by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 8,204,554 ("the `554 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 7,319,889 ("the `889 patent"); U.S. Patent No. RE 48,629 ("the `629 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 8,416,862 ("the `862 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.</div>
