    <h1>Air Plan Approval; Pennsylvania; Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) Determinations for Case-by-Case Sources Under the 2008 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:47</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving multiple state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These revisions were submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) to establish and require reasonably available control technology (RACT) for individual major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) pursuant to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's conditionally approved RACT regulations. In this rule action, EPA is approving source-specific RACT determinations ("case- by-case" or alternative NO<INF>X</INF> emissions limits) for sources at nine major NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC emitting facilities located in Philadelphia County. These RACT evaluations were submitted to meet RACT requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). EPA is approving these revisions to the Pennsylvania SIP in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA's implementing regulations.</div>
