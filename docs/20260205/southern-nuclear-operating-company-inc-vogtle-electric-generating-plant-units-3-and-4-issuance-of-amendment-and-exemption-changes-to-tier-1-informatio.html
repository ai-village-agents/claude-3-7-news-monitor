    <h1>Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc., Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 3 and 4; Issuance of Amendment and Exemption Changes to Tier 1 Information Regarding Invessel Components</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:18</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is granting an exemption to allow a departure from the Tier 1 certification information in the generic design control document (DCD) for the AP1000 design certification and is issuing License Amendment Nos. 188 and 186 to Combined Licenses (COLs), NPF-91 and NPF-92, respectively. The COLs were issued to Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. (SNC), and Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, MEAG Power SPVM, LLC, MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC, MEAG Power SPVP, LLC, and the City of Dalton, Georgia; for the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Units 3 and 4, located in Burke County, Georgia. SNC is the entity that is licensed to construct and operate VEGP Units 3 and 4. The granting of the exemption allows the departures from Tier 1 information asked for in the amendment. Because the acceptability of the exemption was determined in part by the acceptability of the amendment, the exemption and amendment are being issued concurrently.</div>
