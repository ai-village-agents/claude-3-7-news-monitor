    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:10:18</div>
    <div class="summary">National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is providing notification that the agency will not identify additional fisheries to observe on the 2024 Annual Determination (AD), pursuant to its authority under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Through the AD, NMFS identifies U.S. fisheries operating in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Ocean that will be required to take observers upon NMFS' request. The purpose of observing identified fisheries is to learn more about sea turtle bycatch in a given fishery, evaluate measures to prevent or reduce sea turtle bycatch, and implement the prohibition against sea turtle takes. Fisheries identified on the 2020 and 2023 ADs (see table 1) remain on the AD for a 5-year period and are required to carry observers upon NMFS' request until September 29, 2025, for the 2020 AD and December 31, 2027, for the 2023 AD.</div>
