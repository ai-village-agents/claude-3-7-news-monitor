    <div class="summary">The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is providing an additional thirty (30) days for public comments on a proposed rule that would terminate the Federal marketing order regulating the handling of onions grown in South Texas and the rules and regulations issued thereunder. A corresponding change would be made to the onion import regulation as required under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. Reopening the comment period gives interested persons an additional opportunity to comment on the proposed termination.</div>
