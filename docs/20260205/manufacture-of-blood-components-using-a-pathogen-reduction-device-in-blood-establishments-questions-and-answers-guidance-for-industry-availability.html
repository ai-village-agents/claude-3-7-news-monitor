    <h1>Manufacture of Blood Components Using a Pathogen Reduction Device in Blood Establishments: Questions and Answers; Guidance for Industry; Availability</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:12</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Manufacture of Blood Components Using a Pathogen Reduction Device in Blood Establishments: Questions and Answers; Guidance for Industry." The guidance document provides blood establishments that collect or process blood and blood components with recommendations for implementing a pathogen reduction device for the manufacture of pathogen-reduced blood components. The guidance, in a question-and-answer format, addresses the most frequently asked questions concerning implementation of the INTERCEPT[supreg] Blood System for Platelets and Plasma. The guidance also provides recommendations to licensed manufacturers on reporting the manufacturing changes associated with implementation of a pathogen reduction device. The guidance announced in this notice finalizes the draft document entitled "Implementation of Pathogen Reduction Technology in the Manufacture of Blood Components in Blood Establishments: Questions and Answers; Draft Guidance for Industry," dated December 2017.</div>
