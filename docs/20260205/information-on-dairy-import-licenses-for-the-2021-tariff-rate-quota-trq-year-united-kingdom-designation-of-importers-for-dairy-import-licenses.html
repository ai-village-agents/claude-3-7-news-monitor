    <h1>Information on Dairy Import Licenses for the 2021 Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ) Year-United Kingdom Designation of Importers for Dairy Import Licenses</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:06</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has determined that, for the 2021 quota year, the United Kingdom (UK) may designate importers to receive import licenses for specified quantities under certain dairy tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) allocated to the EU-27. In accordance with the definitions in Chapter 4 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), the UK continues to be eligible to export under dairy TRQ allocations to the EU-27. In previous years, the European Commission (EC) designated importers on behalf of the UK and all other eligible European Union (EU) Member States for dairy TRQ amounts reserved for designated licenses. However, the EC has informed the United States that it no longer has the authority to designate importers on behalf of UK exporters for trade transactions that will occur after December 31, 2020. Accordingly, the EU and the UK have each requested that the UK be permitted to designate importers for portions of certain dairy TRQs for the 2021 quota year. The USDA has agreed to the EU's and UK's requests.</div>
