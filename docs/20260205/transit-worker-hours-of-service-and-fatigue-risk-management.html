    <h1>Transit Worker Hours of Service and Fatigue Risk Management</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:07</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is considering proposing minimum safety standards to provide protections for transit workers to obtain adequate rest thereby reducing the risk of fatigue- related safety incidents. FTA seeks public input in two areas: hours of service; and fatigue risk management programs. FTA seeks information to understand better current industry practices, priorities, requirements, and the costs and benefits of Federal requirements. The information received in response to this ANPRM will assist FTA as it considers potential regulatory requirements.</div>
