    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company Turbofan Engines</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:49</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all General Electric Company (GE) Passport 20-17BB1A, Passport 20- 18BB1A, and Passport 20-19BB1A model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a manufacturing quality escape that requires a reduction to the life limit of certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 disks. This proposed AD would require revising the Airworthiness Limitations section (ALS) of the GE Passport 20 Line Maintenance Manual and the operator's existing approved continuous airworthiness maintenance program (CAMP) to incorporate a reduced life limit for certain HPT rotor stage 1 disks. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
