    <h1>Policy on the Definition of Aeronautical Activities</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:28</div>
    <div class="summary">This notice announces a proposed update of the FAA's Office of Airports policy regarding the definition of "aeronautical activity" to include unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), advanced air mobility (AAM), and commercial space launch or re-entry vehicle operations. Under Federal law, an airport operator that has accepted Federal grants or certain Federal land conveyances is obligated to maintain the airport for public aviation use. This proposed update will add UAS, AAM, and commercial space operations to the existing definition of aeronautical activity that is included in FAA Order 5190.6B, FAA Airport Compliance Manual, Appendix Z, and subsequent revisions. This revised definition does not affect any international agreements or policies regarding commercial space operations. The FAA is seeking comments on the proposed statement of policy.</div>
