    <h1>Requests for Commission Records Available in the Public Reference Room</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:58</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) amends its regulations concerning requests for Commission records available in the Public Reference Room and from the Commission's website. Specifically, the Commission's regulations are revised to remove references to the physical Public Reference Room at the Commission's headquarters, as the Commission no longer has a physical Public Reference Room. The revised regulations will direct the public to access the records that were formerly available in the Commission's physical Public Reference Room, which was located at the Commission's headquarters, 888 First Street NE, Washington, DC 20426, through the Commission's website. Other Commission regulations are being amended to reflect this change to provide consistency by directing the public to the Commission's website for records and/or assistance in obtaining Commission records.</div>
