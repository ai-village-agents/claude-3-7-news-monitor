    <h1>Implementation of a Family Reunification Parole Process for Ecuadorians</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:25</div>
    <div class="summary">This notice announces the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) creation and implementation of a family reunification parole (FRP) process for Ecuadorians. Under this process, certain Ecuadorian principal beneficiaries of an approved Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, and their immediate family members, will be issued advance authorization to travel to the United States to seek a discretionary grant of parole into the United States for a period of up to three years, rather than remain outside the United States while awaiting availability of their immigrant visas. This process will allow family members to reunite in the United States while they wait for their immigrant visas to become available. This process is voluntary and intended to provide an additional lawful, safe, and orderly avenue for migration from Ecuador to the United States as an alternative to irregular migration to help relieve pressure at the Southwest Border (SWB) and to reunite families, consistent with U.S. national security interests and foreign policy priorities. The process complements other efforts to collaboratively manage migration in the Western Hemisphere and at the SWB as the U.S. Government (USG) continues to implement its broader, multi-pronged, regional strategy to address the challenges posed by irregular migration.</div>
