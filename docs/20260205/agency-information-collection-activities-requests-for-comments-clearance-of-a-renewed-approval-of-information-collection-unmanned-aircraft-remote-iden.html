    <h1>Agency Information Collection Activities: Requests for Comments; Clearance of a Renewed Approval of Information Collection: Unmanned Aircraft Remote Identification Message Elements</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:42</div>
    <div class="summary">In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves electronic information that is broadcast directly from certain unmanned aircraft, specifically standard remote identification unmanned aircraft and unmanned aircraft equipped with a remote identification broadcast module. With certain limited exceptions, the Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft rule prohibits the operation of unmanned aircraft within the airspace of the United States unless the unmanned aircraft are broadcasting certain remote identification message elements throughout their operation. An exception to the general rule is when an unmanned aircraft is not equipped with remote identification equipment but is operated within visual line of sight and within an FAA-recognized identification area.</div>
