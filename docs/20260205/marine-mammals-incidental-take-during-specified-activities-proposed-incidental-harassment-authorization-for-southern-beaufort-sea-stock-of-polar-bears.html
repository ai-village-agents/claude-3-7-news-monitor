    <h1>Marine Mammals; Incidental Take During Specified Activities; Proposed Incidental Harassment Authorization for Southern Beaufort Sea Stock of Polar Bears in the Prudhoe Bay Unit and Point Thomson Unit of the North Slope of Alaska</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:52</div>
    <div class="summary">We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, received a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 from JADE Energy, LLC, for authorization to take by Level B harassment a small number of polar bears from the Southern Beaufort Sea (SBS) stock incidental to oil and gas exploratory activities scheduled to occur between December 1, 2021, through November 30, 2022. These activities include mobilization, constructing ice roads and ice pads, drilling wells, and associated cleanup in the Prudhoe Bay Unit and Point Thomson Unit of the North Slope of Alaska. Mobilization would occur in December 2021, along a winter trail stretching east from Deadhorse, Alaska, to Point Thomson, Alaska. Prepacking of snow and construction of ice roads and pads would begin mid-December 2021, and drilling would begin at JADE #1 pad in late-January 2022. If conditions are favorable, drilling on JADE #2 pad would take place in mid-March 2022, preceding cleanup activities, which are proposed to be completed by July 15, 2022. We estimate these activities may result in the nonlethal incidental take of up to two SBS stock polar bears. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for take of two SBS stock polar bears by Level B harassment only. No lethal or Level A take of polar bears is likely or requested, and, therefore, such take is not included in this proposed authorization.</div>
