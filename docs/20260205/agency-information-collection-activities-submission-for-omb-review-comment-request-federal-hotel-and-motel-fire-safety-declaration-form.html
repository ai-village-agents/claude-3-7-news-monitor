    <h1>Agency Information Collection Activities: Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Federal Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Declaration Form</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:37</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will submit the information collection abstracted below to the Office of Management and Budget for review and clearance in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. FEMA, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on an extension without change of a currently approved information collection. This notice seeks comments concerning a list of hotels, motels, and similar places of public accommodations meeting minimum fire-safety requirements. The information collected is voluntary and if approved for listing, the lodging establishment may be used by Federal employees on government related travel and for Federal agency conferences. As the list is open to use by the public, non-government travelers may use the list to identify lodging meeting minimum life- safety criteria from fire.</div>
