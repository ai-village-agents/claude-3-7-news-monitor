    <div class="summary">The Commission is proposing to grant exemptive relief, subject to certain conditions, from compliance with certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with a program to portfolio margin cleared swaps customer and affiliate positions in cleared credit default swaps that are swaps and security-based swaps in a segregated account established and maintained in accordance with Section 4d(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act (in the case of a cleared swaps customer) or a cleared swaps proprietary account (in the case of an affiliate). This proposed exemptive relief would supersede and replace the Commission's Order Granting Conditional Exemptions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Connection with Portfolio Margining of Swaps and Security-based Swaps issued in December 2012.</div>
