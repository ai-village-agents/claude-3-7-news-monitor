    <h1>Information Collection Request Submitted to OMB for Review and Approval; Comment Request; Acid Rain Program (Renewal)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:49</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has submitted an information collection request (ICR), Acid Rain Program (EPA ICR Number 1633.18, OMB Control Number 2060-0258) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This is a proposed extension of the ICR, which is currently approved through December 31, 2021. Public comments were previously requested via the Federal Register on April 2, 2021 during a 60-day comment period. This notice allows for an additional 30 days for public comments. A fuller description of the ICR is given below, including its estimated burden and cost to the public. An agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</div>
