    <h1>Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee; Notice of Meeting; Establishment of a Public Docket; Request for Comments</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:01:21</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) announces a forthcoming public advisory committee meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. The general function of the committee is to provide advice and recommendations to the Agency on FDA's regulatory issues. The meeting will be open to the public. FDA is establishing a docket for public comment on this document. Consistent with FDA's regulations, this notice is being published with less than 15 days prior to the date of the meeting based on a determination that convening a meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee as soon as possible is warranted. This Federal Register notice could not be published 15 days prior to the date of the meeting due to a recent submission of a request for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for an investigational vaccine to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the need for prompt discussion of such submission, given the COVID-19 pandemic.</div>
