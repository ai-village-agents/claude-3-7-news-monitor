    <h1>Extension of the Designation of South Sudan for Temporary Protected Status</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:03</div>
    <div class="summary">Through this notice, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is extending the designation of South Sudan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months, from November 3, 2020, through May 2, 2022. The extension allows currently eligible TPS beneficiaries to retain TPS through May 2, 2022, so long as they otherwise continue to meet the eligibility requirements for TPS. This notice also sets forth procedures necessary for nationals of South Sudan (or aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in South Sudan) to re-register for TPS and to apply for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS will issue new EADs with a May 2, 2022, expiration date to eligible beneficiaries under South Sudan's TPS designation who timely re- register and apply for EADs under this extension.</div>
