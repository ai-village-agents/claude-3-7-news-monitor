    <div class="summary">NMFS has received a request from the U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on behalf of the Pacific Air Forces Regional Support Center (USAF) for authorization to take marine mammals incidental to the Eareckson Air Station (EAS) Fuel Pier Repair in Alcan Harbor, Shemya Island, Alaska. Pursuant to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), NMFS is requesting comments on its proposal to issue an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to incidentally take marine mammals during the specified activities. NMFS is also requesting comments on a possible one-time, 1-year renewal that could be issued under certain circumstances and if all requirements are met, as described in the Request for Public Comments section at the end of this notice. NMFS will consider public comments prior to making any final decision on the issuance of the requested MMPA authorization and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.</div>
