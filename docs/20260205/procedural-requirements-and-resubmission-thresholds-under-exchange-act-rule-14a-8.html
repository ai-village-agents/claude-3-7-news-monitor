    <h1>Procedural Requirements and Resubmission Thresholds Under Exchange Act Rule 14a-8</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:12</div>
    <div class="summary">We are adopting amendments to certain procedural requirements and the provision relating to resubmitted proposals under the shareholder-proposal rule in order to modernize and enhance the efficiency and integrity of the shareholder-proposal process for the benefit of all shareholders. The amendments to the procedural rules: Amend the current ownership requirements to incorporate a tiered approach that provides three options for demonstrating a sufficient ownership stake in a company--through a combination of amount of securities owned and length of time held--to be eligible to submit a proposal; require certain documentation to be provided when a proposal is submitted on behalf of a shareholder-proponent; require shareholder- proponents to identify specific dates and times they can meet with the company in person or via teleconference to engage with the company with respect to the proposal; and provide that a person may submit no more than one proposal, directly or indirectly, for the same shareholders' meeting. The amendments to the resubmission thresholds revise the levels of shareholder support a proposal must receive to be eligible for resubmission at the same company's future shareholders' meetings from 3, 6, and 10 percent to 5, 15, and 25 percent, respectively.</div>
