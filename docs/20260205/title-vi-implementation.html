    <h1>Title VI Implementation</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:19</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is considering amending Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients (Title VI Circular) to incorporate lessons learned since its issuance on October 1, 2012. The Title VI Circular provides guidance and instructions to FTA recipients of Federal financial assistance on how to comply with requirements under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the DOT Title VI regulations at 49 CFR part 21, which prohibit discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs. The agency is seeking suggestions from all transit stakeholders--including transit agencies, transit riders and community members, planning officials, States, cities, and the private sector--on enhancements that could be made to the Title VI Circular to provide clarity, to ensure Title VI requirements are met, and to advance equity. Specifically, FTA seeks input on requirements related to public participation, service and fare equity, facility equity analyses, implementation of rider conduct policies, and additional technical resources for determining and documenting disparate impact.</div>
