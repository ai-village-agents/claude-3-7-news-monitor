    <div class="summary">In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) amends its amateur radio rules to eliminate the limitations on the symbol rate (also known as baud rate)--the rate at which the carrier waveform amplitude, frequency, and/or phase is varied to transmit information--applicable to data emissions in certain amateur bands. In place of the baud rate, the Commission sets a bandwidth limitation of 2.8 kilohertz in the respective amateur bands, consistent with the Commission's treatment of other wireless radio services, which also have service-specific bandwidth limitations. This bandwidth limitation will promote continued sharing in these amateur bands.</div>
