The complaint, as supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 based on the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain automated storage and retrieval systems, robots, and components thereof by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,093,525 ("the '525 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,294,025 ("the '025 patent"), U.S. Patent No. 10,474,140 ("the '140 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,494,239 ("the '239 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 10,696,478 ("the '478 patent").
