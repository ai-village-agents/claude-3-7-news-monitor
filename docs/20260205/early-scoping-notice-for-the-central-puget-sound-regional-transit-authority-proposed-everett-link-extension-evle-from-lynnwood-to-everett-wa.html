    <h1>Early Scoping Notice for the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority Proposed Everett Link Extension (EVLE) From Lynnwood to Everett, WA</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:37</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (Sound Transit) issue this early scoping notice to advise tribes, agencies, and the public that FTA and Sound Transit will explore potential route and station alternatives for the Everett Link light rail extension (EVLE or Project) and are starting to determine the scope of the environmental issues associated with the Project. The Project would extend Link light rail from the Lynnwood City Center Station to the Everett Station area in Snohomish County, Washington, and improve connections to the regional transit system and major activity centers. Potential alternatives for a light rail operations and maintenance facility (OMF North) in Snohomish County will also be explored to support the regional Link light rail program, including EVLE.</div>
