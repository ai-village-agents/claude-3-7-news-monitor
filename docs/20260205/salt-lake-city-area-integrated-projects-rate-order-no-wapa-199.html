    <h1>Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects-Rate Order No. WAPA-199</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:38</div>
    <div class="summary">The fixed firm power rates for the Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects (SLCA/IP) (Provisional Rates) have been confirmed, approved, and placed into effect on an interim basis. Based on the FY 2021 financial toll on the Upper Colorado River Basin Fund (Basin Fund) and the drought-impacted purchased power projections from the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) August 2021 24-Month Study for FY 2022 and FY 2023 and the August 2021 Colorado River Simulation System (CRSS) traces for FY 2024 through FY 2026, existing rates will not sustain a balance in the Basin Fund capable of supporting operations. The Colorado River Storage Project Management Center (CRSP MC) of the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) is implementing a new SLCA/IP firm power rate, effective December 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023.</div>
