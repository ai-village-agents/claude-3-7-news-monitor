    <h1>Management and Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska; Extension of Comment Period</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:23:49</div>
    <div class="summary">On September 8, 2023, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would revise the framework for designating and assuring maximum protection of Special Areas' significant resource values and protect and enhance access for subsistence activities throughout the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A). The proposed rule would also incorporate aspects of the NPR-A Integrated Activity Plan approved in April 2022. On October 24, 2023, the BLM extended the comment period to November 17, 2023. The BLM has determined that it is appropriate to further extend the comment period for the proposed rule by 20 days, until December 7, 2023, to allow for additional public comment.</div>
