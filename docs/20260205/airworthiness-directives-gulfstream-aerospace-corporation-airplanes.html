    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:47</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-12-06, which applies to all Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Gulfstream) Model G-IV airplanes. AD 2020-12-06 requires replacing the nose wheel steering servo valve manifold, incorporating revised operating procedures into the airplane flight manual (AFM), doing a records inspection for any incidents of un-commanded nose wheel steering turns, and reporting the results to the FAA. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-12-06, the FAA determined that a typographical error was made in a citing one of the AFM documents. This proposed AD would retain the actions of AD 2020-12-06 and would correct the citation to the AFM. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
