    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:28</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is amending the Yemen Sanctions Regulations and reissuing them in their entirety to further implement Executive Order 13611 of May 16, 2012, "Blocking Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, or Stability of Yemen." This final rule replaces the regulations that were published in abbreviated form on November 9, 2012, with a more comprehensive set of regulations that includes additional interpretive and definitional guidance, general licenses, statements of licensing policy, and other regulatory provisions that will provide further guidance to the public. Due to the number of regulatory sections being updated or added, OFAC is reissuing the Yemen Sanctions Regulations in their entirety.</div>
