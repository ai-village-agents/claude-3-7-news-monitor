    <div class="summary">The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Alaska State Office, announces the availability of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Willow Master Development Plan (MDP) Project. The ROD includes a deferral on a decision for drill sites 4 and 5 and associated gravel roads and pipelines, at the request of the project proponent. The ROD constitutes the final decision of the BLM on the remainder of the project and completes the required National Environmental Policy Act process for subsequent issuance of appropriate BLM rights-of-way grant, permits to drill, and other authorizations necessary for initial development of the Willow MDP Project.</div>
