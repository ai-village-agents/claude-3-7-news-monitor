    <h1>Applicability of the Registration, Financial Responsibility, and Safety Regulations to Motor Carriers of Passengers</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:17</div>
    <div class="summary">This interpretive rule adds appendices to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to explain existing statutes and regulations FMCSA administers related to: the applicability of the FMCSRs, including the financial responsibility regulations, to motor carriers of passengers operating in interstate commerce, including limitations on such applicability based on characteristics of the vehicle operated or the scope of operations conducted; and the applicability of commercial operating authority registration based on the Agency's jurisdiction over motor carriers of passengers, regardless of vehicle characteristics, when operating for-hire in interstate commerce. Under certain conditions, motor carriers performing intrastate movements of passengers may still be operating in interstate commerce and, unless otherwise exempt, are subject to applicable FMCSA statutory and regulatory requirements. FMCSA wants motor carriers of passengers and the public to be aware of the applicable regulations and requirements.</div>
