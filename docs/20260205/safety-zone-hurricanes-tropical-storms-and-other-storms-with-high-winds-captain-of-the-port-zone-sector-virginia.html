This action is necessary to ensure the safety of the waters of the Sector Virginia COTP Zone. This rule establishes actions to be completed by industry and vessels within the COTP Zone before hurricanes, tropical storms, and other storms with high winds threatening the State of Virginia make landfall, and afterwards as well.</div>
