    <h1>Driver Qualification Files: Application for Exemption; Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc.</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:07</div>
    <div class="summary">FMCSA announces its decision to grant, with conditions, Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc.'s (Knight-Swift) application for an exemption from the requirement that motor carriers rely on the motor vehicle record (MVR) of their drivers holding a commercial driver's license (CDL) as proof of the driver's medical qualifications when the driver undergoes a new medical exam during the initial period of employment as a condition of employment. Knight-Swift would rely on the medical long form for newly hired drivers and then rely on the MVR when the subsequent annual review of the driving record is performed. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the applicant would achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.</div>
