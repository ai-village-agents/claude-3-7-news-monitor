    <div class="summary">The Farm Credit Administration is correcting a final rule published in the Federal Register. On October 6, 2020, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA, we, or our) adopted a final rule that amended our investment regulations to allow Farm Credit System (FCS or System) associations to purchase and hold the portion of certain loans that non-FCS lenders originate and sell in the secondary market, and that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) unconditionally guarantees or insures as to the timely payment of principal and interest. In that publication, the amendatory instruction to revise paragraph (b)(3) of 12 CFR 615.5140 is incorrect. This document corrects that error.</div>
