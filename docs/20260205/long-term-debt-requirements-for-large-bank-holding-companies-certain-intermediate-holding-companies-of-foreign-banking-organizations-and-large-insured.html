    <div class="summary">On September 19, 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (collectively, the "agencies") published in the Federal Register a proposal to require certain large depository institution holding companies, U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, and insured depository institutions, to issue and maintain outstanding a minimum amount of long-term debt. The agencies have determined that an extension of the comment period until January 16, 2024, is appropriate.</div>
