    <h1>Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico; 2023 Red Snapper Private Angling Component Closures in Federal Waters off Texas</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:17</div>
    <div class="summary">NMFS announces a closure for the 2023 fishing season for the red snapper private angling component in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Texas in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) through this temporary rule. The red snapper recreational private angling component in the Gulf EEZ off Texas will close on January 1, 2023, until 12:01 a.m., local time, on June 1, 2023. This closure is necessary to prevent the private angling component from exceeding the Texas regional management area annual catch limit (ACL) and to prevent overfishing of the Gulf red snapper resource.</div>
