    <h1>Schedules of Controlled Substances: Removal of [18F]FP-CIT From Control</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:39</div>
    <div class="summary">The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes to remove [\18\F]FP-CIT (chemical names: [\18\F]N-[omega]-fluoropropyl-[beta]- CIT; fluorine-18-N-3-fluoropropyl-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4- iodophenyl)tropane; [\18\F]fluoropropylcarbomethoxy nortropane) from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This scheduling action is pursuant to the CSA which requires that such actions be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing through formal rulemaking. [\18\F]FP-CIT is currently a schedule II controlled substance because it can be derived from cocaine, a schedule II substance, via ecgonine, also a schedule II substance. This action would remove the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances, including those specific to schedule II controlled substances, on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, dispense, conduct research, import, export, or conduct chemical analysis) or propose to handle [\18\F]FP-CIT.</div>
