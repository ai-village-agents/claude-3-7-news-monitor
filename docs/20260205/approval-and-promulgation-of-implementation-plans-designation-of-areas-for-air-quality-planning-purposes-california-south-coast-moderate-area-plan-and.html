    <h1>Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; California; South Coast Moderate Area Plan and Reclassification as Serious Nonattainment for the 2012 PM2.5 NAAQS</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:56</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve or conditionally approve portions of a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by California to address Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements for the 2006 and 2012 fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin ("South Coast") PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area. Specifically, the EPA is approving all but the contingency measure element of the submitted SIP revision as meeting all applicable Moderate area requirements for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, and conditionally approving the contingency measure element as meeting both the Moderate area contingency measure requirement for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS and the Serious area contingency measure requirement for the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. In addition, the EPA is approving 2019 and 2022 motor vehicle emissions budgets for use in transportation conformity analyses for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The EPA is also reclassifying the South Coast PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area, including reservation areas of Indian country and any other area of Indian country within it where the EPA or a tribe has demonstrated that the tribe has jurisdiction, as a Serious nonattainment area for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS based on the EPA's determination that the area cannot practicably attain the standard by the applicable Moderate area attainment date of December 31, 2021. As a consequence of this reclassification, California is required to submit a Serious area attainment plan that includes a demonstration of attainment of the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS in the South Coast area as expeditiously as practicable and no later than December 31, 2025.</div>
