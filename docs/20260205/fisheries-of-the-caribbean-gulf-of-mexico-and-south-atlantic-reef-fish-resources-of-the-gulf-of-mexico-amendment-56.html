    <h1>Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico; Amendment 56</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:48:23</div>
    <div class="summary">NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in Amendment 56 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented for gag in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), this proposed rule would revise catch levels, recreational accountability measures (AMs), and the recreational fishing season. In addition, Amendment 56 would establish a rebuilding plan for the overfished stock, revise stock status determination criteria, and sector harvest allocations. The purpose of this action is to implement a rebuilding plan for gag and revised management measures to end overfishing and rebuild the stock.</div>
