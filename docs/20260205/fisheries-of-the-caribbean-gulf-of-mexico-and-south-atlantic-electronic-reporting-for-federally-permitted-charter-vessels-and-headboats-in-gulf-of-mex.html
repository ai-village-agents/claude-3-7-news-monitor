    <div class="summary">NMFS further delays the effective date for previously approved vessel location tracking requirements applicable to an owner or operator of charter vessel or headboat for which NMFS has issued a valid Federal charter vessel/headboat permit for federally managed reef fish or coastal migratory pelagic (CMP) species in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). This delay of the effective date will provide additional time for NMFS to complete testing of an additional vessel location tracking unit and provide additional time for litigation challenging these requirements to progress.</div>
