    <div class="summary">This document sets forth a proposed regulation that would amend the rules applicable to plans that include cash or deferred arrangements under section 401(k) to provide guidance with respect to long-term, part-time employees. The proposed regulation reflects statutory changes made by the SECURE Act and the SECURE 2.0 Act that relate to long-term, part-time employees. The proposed regulation would affect participants in, beneficiaries of, employers maintaining, and administrators of plans that include cash or deferred arrangements. This document also provides notice of a public hearing.</div>
