    <div class="summary">This supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking ("SNPRM") updates the Copyright Office's July 17, 2020 proposed rule concerning the Music Modernization Act transition period transfer and reporting of royalties to the mechanical licensing collective. Specifically, this SNPRM provides an alternate approach to requirements concerning the content of cumulative statements of account to be submitted by digital music providers to the mechanical licensing collective at the conclusion of the statutory transition period and proposes estimate and adjustment provisions with respect to payment of accrued royalties to the mechanical licensing collective in connection with this reporting.</div>
