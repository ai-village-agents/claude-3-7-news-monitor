    <h1>Flight Attendant Duty Period Limitations and Rest Requirements</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:36</div>
    <div class="summary">This action arises out of a statutory mandate in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which requires rulemaking to increase the minimum rest period for flight attendants in domestic, flag, and supplemental operations who are scheduled for a duty period of 14 hours or less. The statute also requires rulemaking to prohibit a reduction of the rest period under any circumstances. Consistent with the statutory mandate, the FAA proposes to amend its regulations to ensure that flight attendants scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours or less are given a scheduled rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours and that the rest period is not reduced under any circumstances.</div>
