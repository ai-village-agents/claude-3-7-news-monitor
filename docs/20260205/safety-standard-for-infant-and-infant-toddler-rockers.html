    <h1>Safety Standard for Infant and Infant/Toddler Rockers</h1>

    <div class="summary">The Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act, section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), requires the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) to promulgate consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products. These standards are to be substantially the same as applicable voluntary standards, or more stringent than the voluntary standards if the Commission concludes that more stringent requirements would further reduce the risk of injury associated with the product. The Commission is proposing a safety standard for Infant and Infant/Toddler Rockers (rockers). The Commission is also proposing to amend CPSC's consumer registration requirements to add rockers as identified durable infant or toddler products and to amend CPSC's list of notice of requirements (NORs) to include rockers.</div>
