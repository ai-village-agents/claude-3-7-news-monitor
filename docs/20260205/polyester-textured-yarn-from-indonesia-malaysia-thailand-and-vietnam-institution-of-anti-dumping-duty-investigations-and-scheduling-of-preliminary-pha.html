    <div class="summary">The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of investigations and commencement of preliminary phase antidumping duty investigation Nos. 731-TA-1550-1553 (Preliminary) pursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930 ("the Act") to determine whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports of polyester textured yarn from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, provided for in subheadings 5402.33.3000 and 5402.33.6000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value. Unless the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") extends the time for initiation, the Commission must reach a preliminary determination in antidumping duty investigations in 45 days, or in this case by December 14, 2020. The Commission's views must be transmitted to Commerce within five business days thereafter, or by December 21, 2020.</div>
