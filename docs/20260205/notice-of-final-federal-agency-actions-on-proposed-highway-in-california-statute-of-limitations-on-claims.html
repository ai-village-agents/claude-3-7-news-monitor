    <h1>Notice of Final Federal Agency Actions on Proposed Highway in California; Statute of Limitations on Claims</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:13</div>
    <div class="summary">The FHWA, on behalf of Caltrans, is issuing this notice to announce Caltrans' adoption of the Maritime Administration's (MARAD) Combined Final Environmental Impact Statement/Record of Decision and Final Section 4(f) Evaluation, (FEIS/ROD) for the Port of Long Beach (POLB or Port) Pier B On-Dock Rail Support Facility Project (Project). The Final EIS and ROD for the Pier B On-Dock Rail Support Facility Project were approved by MARAD on April 7, 2022. MARAD's Notice of Availability for the Final EIS and ROD was published in the Federal Register on April 15, 2022. Under 49 U.S.C. 304a(b), MARAD issued a single Final EIS and ROD (USEPA, 2022). Therefore, the 30-day wait/ review period under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) did not apply to the action (Federal Register, 2022). Pursuant to 40 CFR 1506.3(b)(2), Caltrans was a cooperating agency on this project. Therefore, recirculation of the document is not necessary under Section 1506.3(c) of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations.</div>
