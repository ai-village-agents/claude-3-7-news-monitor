    <h1>60-Day Notice for the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Research Study Proposed Collection; Comment Request</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:59</div>
    <div class="summary">The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the NEA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed collection of information from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for the HBCU Research Study. A copy of the current information collection request can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the address section of this notice.</div>
