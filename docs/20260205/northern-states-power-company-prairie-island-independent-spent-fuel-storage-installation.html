    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviewed an application by Northern States Power Company (NSPM) for amendment of Special Nuclear Materials License No. SNM-2506 which authorizes NSPM to receive, possess, store, and transfer spent nuclear fuel and associated radioactive materials. The amendment sought to increase the maximum amount of spent fuel that may be possessed and stored at the Prairie Island Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (PI ISFSI) and approval of the construction of an additional concrete pad within the confines of the existing facility.</div>
