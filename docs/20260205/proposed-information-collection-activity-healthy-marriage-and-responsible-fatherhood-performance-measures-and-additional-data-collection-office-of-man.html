    <div class="summary">The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Family Assistance (OFA), is requesting an extension with changes to its approved collection and reporting of performance measures about program operations, services, and clients served through the Healthy Marriage (HM) and Responsible Fatherhood (RF) grant programs. In an effort to gain a greater understanding of how HMRF programs influence program participants and staff at an individual level, ACF proposes to add one open field to the quarterly narrative reports to capture information about the experiences of HMRF participants and/or staff. ACF is requesting to extend approval, with the implementation of this change, for 3 years.</div>
