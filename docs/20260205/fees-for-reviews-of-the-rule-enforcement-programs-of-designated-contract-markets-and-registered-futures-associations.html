    <h1>Fees for Reviews of the Rule Enforcement Programs of Designated Contract Markets and Registered Futures Associations</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:58</div>
    <div class="summary">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") charges fees to designated contract markets and registered futures associations to recover the costs incurred by the Commission in the operation of its program of oversight of self- regulatory organization rule enforcement programs, specifically the National Futures Association ("NFA"), a registered futures association, and the designated contract markets. Fees collected from each self-regulatory organization are deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts. The calculation of the fee amounts charged for 2022 by this document is based upon an average of actual program costs incurred during fiscal year ("FY") 2019, FY 2020, and FY 2021.</div>
