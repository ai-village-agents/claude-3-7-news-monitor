    <h1>Air Plan Approval; Ohio; Base Year Emission Inventories and Emissions Statement Rule Certification for the 2015 Ozone Standard</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:53</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency on July 24, 2020. The CAA establishes emission inventory requirements for all ozone nonattainment areas. The revision will address the emission inventory requirements for the Cleveland, Ohio (OH) nonattainment area and the Ohio portion of the Cincinnati, Ohio-Kentucky (Cincinnati) ozone nonattainment area, as designated under the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard). Also, EPA is proposing to approve Ohio's certification that its stationary annual emissions statement regulation, which has been previously approved by EPA under a prior ozone standard, satisfies the CAA emissions statement rule requirement for the Cleveland and Cincinnati nonattainment areas under the 2015 ozone NAAQS.</div>
