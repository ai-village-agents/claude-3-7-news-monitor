    <h1>Amendments to National Security License Review Policy Under the Export Administration Regulations</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:28</div>
    <div class="summary">In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to revise the license review policy for items controlled for national security reasons destined to the People's Republic of China (PRC), Venezuela, or the Russian Federation (Russia). With this revision, BIS and reviewing agencies will determine whether the export, reexport, or transfer (in- country) of items controlled for National Security (NS) reasons will make a material contribution to the "development," "production," maintenance, repair, or operation of weapons systems of the PRC, Venezuela, or the Russian Federation, as well as setting forth several factors that will be considered in reviewing license applications.</div>
