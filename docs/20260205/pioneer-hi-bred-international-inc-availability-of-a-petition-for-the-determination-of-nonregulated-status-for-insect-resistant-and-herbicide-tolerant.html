    <h1>Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.: Availability of a Petition for the Determination of Nonregulated Status for Insect Resistant and Herbicide-Tolerant Maize</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:13</div>
    <div class="summary">We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has received a petition from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. seeking a determination of nonregulated status for DP23211 maize (corn). The corn is engineered for insect resistance against corn rootworm and contains the gene that codes for the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein responsible for tolerance to glufosinate-ammonium herbicides. DP23211 corn also contains the gene that encodes for the phosphomannose isomerase protein, which is used as a selectable marker. We are making the petition available for review and comment to help us identify potential issues and impacts that APHIS may determine should be considered in our evaluation of the petition.</div>
