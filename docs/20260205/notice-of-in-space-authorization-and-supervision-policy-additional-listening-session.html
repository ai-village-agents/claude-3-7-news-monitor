    <div class="summary">On 9 September 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris, Chair of the National Space Council, requested Council Members to provide "a proposal for the authorization and supervision of commercial novel space activities within 180 days[.]" The White House National Space Council in the Executive Office of the President has held two virtual 2 hour listening sessions to engage with members of the public and learn about novel space capabilities and innovative missions, experiences with United States regulatory bodies, and approaches to mission authorization and supervision that can evolve over time. See Federal Register Notice ID NSPC-2022-0001-0001. The National Space Council is now scheduling a third virtual listening session to accommodate additional speaker requests. Perspectives gathered during the virtual listening sessions will inform the National Space Council as it develops a whole-of-government framework that provides a clear, predictable, and flexible process in furtherance of the United States Space Priorities Framework (December 2021) which states that "U.S regulations must provide clarity and certainty for the authorization and supervision of non-governmental space activities, including for novel activities such as on-orbit services, orbital debris removal, space-based manufacturing, commercial human spaceflight, and recovery and use of space resources."</div>
