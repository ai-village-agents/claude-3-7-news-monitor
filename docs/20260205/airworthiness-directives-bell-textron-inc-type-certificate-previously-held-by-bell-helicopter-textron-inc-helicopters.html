    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Bell Textron Inc. (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.) Helicopters</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:01:20</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is revising an earlier proposed Airworthiness Directive (AD) for Bell Textron Inc. (Bell) Model 205B helicopters which proposed to require reducing the life limit of certain tail rotor (T/R) blades and re-identifying certain T/R blades with a new part number (P/N). The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was prompted by flight testing and fatigue analysis results. This action revises the NPRM by adding additional T/R part numbers (P/Ns) to the proposed applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.</div>
