    <h1>Proposed Information Collection Request; Comment Request; General Administrative Requirements for Assistance Programs</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:44</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR), "General Administrative Requirements for Assistance Programs" (EPA ICR No. 0938.22, OMB Control No. 2030-0020 to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Before doing so, EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below. This is a proposed extension of the ICR, which is currently approved through April 30, 2021. In addition, this ICR includes EPA's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program as a result of the relocation of the DBE Program from the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization to the Office of Grants and Debarment. The information collection activities for the DBE Program were previously covered under OMB Control Number 2090-0030. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</div>
