    <h1>Implementation of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005; Retail Sales; Notice of Transfers Following Importation or Exportation</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:25</div>
    <div class="summary">In March 2006, the President signed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA). The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) promulgated an Interim Final Rule (IFR) on September 26, 2006 (with a technical correction on October 13, 2006), under Docket Number DEA- 291I, to implement the retail sales provisions of the CMEA. Additionally, on April 9, 2007, DEA promulgated an IFR, under Docket Number DEA-292I, to implement section 716 of the CMEA, which required additional reporting for import, export, and international transactions involving all list I and list II chemicals. DEA is finalizing these rulemakings in one action. This final rule adopts, with one technical change, the corrected September 2006 IFR, and adopts, without change, the April 2007 IFR.</div>
