    <h1>Arlington National Cemetery, Withdrawal of Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement Regarding Removal of the Confederate Memorial</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:33</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of the Army is announcing withdrawal of its Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The August 4, 2023, notice announced the Army's intention to prepare an EIS under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The EIS would have addressed potential environmental effects associated with the congressionally-mandated removal of the Confederate Memorial from Arlington National Cemetery (ANC). The Army determined the congressionally-mandated removal action is a non-discretionary action. There would be no reasonably foreseeable significant impacts from any discretionary elements of the proposed action. An EIS is therefore not needed to inform any decision-making for this action. The Army will prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) to analyze and disclose any effects of the discretionary elements of the proposed action, including how to disassemble the Confederate Memorial.</div>
