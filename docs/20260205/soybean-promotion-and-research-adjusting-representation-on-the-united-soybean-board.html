    <h1>Soybean Promotion and Research: Adjusting Representation on the United Soybean Board</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:38</div>
    <div class="summary">This final rule adjusts the number of members on the United Soybean Board (Board) to reflect changes in production levels that have occurred since the Board was last reapportioned in 2018. As required by the Soybean Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act (Act), membership on the Board is reviewed every 3 years and adjustments are made accordingly. This change results in a decrease in Board membership for one State (Alabama), decreasing the total number of Board members from 78 to 77. These changes are reflected in the Soybean Promotion and Research Order (Order) and will be effective with the Secretary of Agriculture's (Secretary) appointments for terms in the year 2022. This final rule also corrects the number of States and units to the Order. Technical corrections to the regulations adjust the number of States and units from 30 to 31.</div>
