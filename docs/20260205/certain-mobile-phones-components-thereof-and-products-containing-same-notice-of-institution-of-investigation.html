    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:23:50</div>
    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on October 11, 2023, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson of Sweden. Supplements were filed on October 31, 2023 and November 9, 2023. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain mobile phones, components thereof, and products containing same by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 10,425,817 ("the '817 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 10,306,669 ("the '669 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 11,317,342 ("the '342 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 11,515,893 ("the '893 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists or is in the process of being established as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.</div>
