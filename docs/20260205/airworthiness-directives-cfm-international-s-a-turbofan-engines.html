    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; CFM International, S.A. Turbofan Engines</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:12:27</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain CFM International, S.A. (CFM) LEAP-1B turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of multiple aborted takeoffs and air turn-backs (ATBs) caused by high-pressure compressor (HPC) stall, which was induced by high levels of non-synchronous vibration (NSV). A subsequent investigation by the manufacturer revealed that wear on the No. 3 bearing spring finger housing can lead to high levels of NSV. This proposed AD would require repetitive calculations of the oil filter delta pressure (OFDP) data and, depending on the results of the calculation, replacement of the No. 3 bearing spring finger housing. This proposed AD would also prohibit installation of an engine with an affected No. 3 bearing spring finger housing onto an airplane that already has one engine with an affected No. 3 bearing spring finger housing installed. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
