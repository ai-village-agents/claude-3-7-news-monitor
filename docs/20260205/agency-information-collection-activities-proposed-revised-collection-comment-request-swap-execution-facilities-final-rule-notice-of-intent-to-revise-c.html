    <div class="summary">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is announcing an opportunity for public comment on the revision of a collection of certain information by the agency. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act ("PRA"), Federal agencies are required to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including proposed extension of an existing collection of information, and to allow 60 days for public comment. The Commission recently adopted a final rule amending requirements for swap execution facilities. This notice republishes the burden in the final rule, and solicits any additional comments on the burden associated with the previously published final rule.</div>
