    <h1>Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Nine Specific Fentanyl-Related Substances in Schedule I</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:51</div>
    <div class="summary">With the issuance of this final rule, the Drug Enforcement Administration places nine fentanyl-related substances, as identified in this final rule, including their isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers whenever the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers, and salts is possible, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. These nine fentanyl-related substances are currently listed in schedule I pursuant to a temporary scheduling order. This action makes permanent the imposition of the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities or chemical analysis with, or possess), or propose to handle these nine specific fentanyl-related controlled substances.</div>
