    <h1>Construction Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements; Proposed Renewal of Information Collection Requirements; Comment Request</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:04</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of Labor (DOL), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre- clearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). The program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is soliciting comments concerning its proposal to renew the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval of the information collection that covers OFCCP's construction recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The current OMB approval for this collection expires on April 30, 2021. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the office listed below in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this Notice or by accessing it at www.regulations.gov.</div>
