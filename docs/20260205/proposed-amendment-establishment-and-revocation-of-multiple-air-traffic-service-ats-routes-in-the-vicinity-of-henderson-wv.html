    <h1>Proposed Amendment, Establishment, and Revocation of Multiple Air Traffic Service (ATS) Routes in the Vicinity of Henderson, WV</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:55</div>
    <div class="summary">This action proposes to amend Jet Route J-134, Area Navigation (RNAV) route Q-67, and VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-45 and V-119; establish RNAV route Q-176; and remove Jet Route J-91 and VOR Federal airway V-174 in the vicinity of Henderson, WV. The Air Traffic Service (ATS) route modifications are necessary due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Henderson, WV, VOR/ Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) navigation aid (NAVAID). The NAVAID provides navigation guidance for portions of the affected air traffic service (ATS) routes. The VOR is being decommissioned as part of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.</div>
