In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), which includes the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP), the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), and Operation Stonegarden (OPSG). This revision removes the OPSG Daily Activity Report (FEMA Form FF-207-FY-21-113 (formerly 089-0- 27)) from the collection.</div>
