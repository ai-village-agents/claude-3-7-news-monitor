    <h1>Notice of Intent/Notice of Realty Action: Proposed Resource Management Plan Amendment and Non-Competitive Direct Sale of Public Land in Johnson County, Wyoming</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:08</div>
    <div class="summary">The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to amend the September 22, 2015, Buffalo Resource Management Plan (RMP) and prepare an associated Environmental Assessment (EA) to identify and allow the non-competitive (direct) sale of 1.13 acres of public lands in Johnson County, Wyoming, to William D. and Bonnie S. Ross. The purpose of the sale would be to resolve an inadvertent unauthorized use of public lands. The sale would be for no less than the appraised fair market value of $555. The sale is subject to the applicable provisions of Sections 203 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), as amended, and the BLM land conveyance regulations. Section 203 of FLPMA requires the parcel to meet disposal criteria for sales in Section 202 of FLPMA, and specifically requires the BLM to identify parcels for disposal within the RMP or amend the RMP to establish the disposal criteria in order to dispose of the parcel.</div>
