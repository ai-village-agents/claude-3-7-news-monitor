    <h1>25-Hour Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) Requirement, New Aircraft Production</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:36:12</div>
    <div class="summary">This rulemaking would increase the recording time of cockpit voice recorders from the mandated 2 hours to a proposed 25-hour recording time for all future manufactured aircraft. This rulemaking would provide accident investigators, aircraft operators, and civil aviation authorities with substantially more cockpit voice recorder data to help find the probable causes of incidents and accidents, prevent future incidents and accidents, and make the FAA's regulations more consistent with existing international requirements.</div>
