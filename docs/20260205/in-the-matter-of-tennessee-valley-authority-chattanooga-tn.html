    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing an Order Imposing Civil Penalty in the amount of $606,942 to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The NRC determined that four violations of NRC's employee protection regulation occurred as identified during two investigations completed on October 3, 2019, and January 21, 2020, by the NRC's Office of Investigations (OI) relating to activities at the TVA. In the first investigation, the NRC determined that a former employee was first subjected to an investigation and then placed on administrative leave on May 25, 2018, in part, for engaging in protected activity. In the second investigation, the NRC determined that a second former employee was subjected to an investigation, placed on paid administrative leave on October 15, 2018, and terminated on January 14, 2019, in part, for engaging in the protected activity. The order is effective on the date of issuance.</div>
