    <div class="summary">The Coast Guard is revising a temporary safety zone that was established for certain waters of the Potomac River. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of persons, and the marine environment from the potential safety hazards associated with construction operations at the new Governor Harry W. Nice/Senator Thomas "Mac" Middleton Memorial (US-301) Bridge, which will occur from 7 a.m. on November 2, 2021, through 8 p.m. on December 31, 2021. This rule will prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Sector Maryland- National Capital Region or a designated representative.</div>
