    <h1>Proposed Modifications to Open Access Transmission Tariff; Public Hearing and Opportunities for Public Review and Comment</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:07</div>
    <div class="summary">Bonneville is initiating a proceeding pursuant to Bonneville's open access transmission tariff (Tariff) and the Federal Power Act to modify the non-rate terms and conditions for transmission and interconnection services in the Tariff. The proposed modifications to Bonneville's Tariff implement a first-ready, first-served cluster study process for all new large generator interconnection requests and establish the transition process available for pending requests received in Bonneville's queue as of 15 days after publication of this notice. The proposed modifications will be effective on June 30, 2024. Bonneville has designated this proceeding Docket No. TC-25.</div>
