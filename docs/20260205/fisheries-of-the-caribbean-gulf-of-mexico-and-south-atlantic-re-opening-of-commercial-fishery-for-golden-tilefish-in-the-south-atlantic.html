    <h1>Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic; Re-Opening of Commercial Fishery for Golden Tilefish in the South Atlantic</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:34</div>
    <div class="summary">NMFS announces the re-opening of the commercial sector for golden tilefish in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the South Atlantic. The 2023 commercial annual catch limits (ACLs) for the hook- and-line and longline components have recently increased through a separate rule. Therefore, NMFS re-opens the hook-and-line and longline components of the commercial sector for golden tilefish in the South Atlantic EEZ to allow the commercial ACL to be caught while increasing the corresponding benefit to the Nation with respect to providing food production.</div>
