    <h1>Implementing Executive Order 13891; Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:30:40</div>
    <div class="summary">This interim rule implements Executive Order (E.O.) 13891, "Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents." This E.O. requires Federal agencies to publish regulations that establish processes and procedures for issuing guidance documents. The interim rule would create a new part 11 in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that outlines HUD policy on guidance documents and how HUD designates guidance documents. The interim rule would also establish a procedure by which the public may petition HUD for the withdrawal or modification of guidance documents, and the process for the public to make comments on certain significant guidance documents.</div>
