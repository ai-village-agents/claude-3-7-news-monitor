    <h1>Substantial Product Hazard List: Window Covering Cords</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:43</div>
    <div class="summary">To address the risk of strangulation to young children associated with certain window covering cords, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is issuing this final rule to deem that one or more of the following readily observable characteristics of window coverings present a substantial product hazard (SPH) under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA): the presence of hazardous operating cords on stock window coverings, the presence of hazardous inner cords on stock and custom window coverings, or the absence of a manufacturer label on stock and custom window coverings. The rule amends regulations which list products that the Commission has determined present an SPH.</div>
