    <h1>Proposed Information Collection Request Renewal; Comment Request; Clean School Bus (CSB) Rebate Program; EPA ICR No. 2461.05, OMB Control No. 2060-0686 (Renewal)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:29</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR) renewal, "Clean School Bus (CSB) Rebate Program" (EPA ICR No. 2461.05, OMB Control No. 260- 0686 (Renewal) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Before doing so, EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described below. An Emergency ICR No. 2780.01 was approved by OMB in September 2023 that included additional data necessary to adequately review and administer the CSB Rebate Program. This ICR renewal consolidates all components of the CSB Rebate Program collection and renews the existing ICR No. 2461.04, which is currently approved through August 31, 2025. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information, unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</div>
