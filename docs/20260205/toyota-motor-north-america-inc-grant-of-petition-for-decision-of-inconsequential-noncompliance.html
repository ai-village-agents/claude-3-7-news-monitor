    <div class="summary">Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (Toyota) has determined that certain model year (MY) 2019-2020 Toyota Tundra motor vehicles do not fully comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 110, Tire Selection and Rims and Motor Home/Recreation Vehicle Trailer Load Carrying Capacity Information for Motor Vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536 Kilograms (10,000 Pounds) or Less.
