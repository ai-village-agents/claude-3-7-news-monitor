    <h1>Agency Information Collection Activities: Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request; Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program and Fire Prevention and Safety Grants-Grant Application Supplemental Information</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:44</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will submit the information collection abstracted below to the Office of Management and Budget for review and clearance in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This notice invites the general public to comment on the extension of a currently approved collection, with changes, concerning the applications for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program, the Fire Prevention and Safety (FP&S) Grants program, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants program, and the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program--COVID-19 Supplemental (AFG-S). These programs focus on enhancing the safety of the public and firefighters with respect to fire and fire-related hazards. The changes proposed will acknowledge the FEMA Grants Outcomes (FEMA GO) system as the new collection instrument for the AFG, AFG-S, SAFER, and FP&S programs. The individual forms will be combined into a question bank to allow the FEMA GO system to fully utilize its technology to simplify the process by reducing unnecessary questions.</div>
