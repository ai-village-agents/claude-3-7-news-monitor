    <h1>Request for Information for the 2024 Trafficking in Persons Report</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:27:56</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of State ("the Department") requests written information to assist in reporting on the degree to which the United States and foreign governments meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons ("minimum standards") that are prescribed by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, as amended ("TVPA"). This information will assist in the preparation of the Trafficking in Persons Report ("TIP Report") that the Department submits annually to the U.S. Congress on governments' concrete actions to meet the minimum standards. Foreign governments that do not meet the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts to do so may be subject to restrictions on nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related foreign assistance from the United States, as defined by the TVPA. Submissions must be made in writing to the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons at the Department of State by February 1, 2024. Please refer to the ADDRESSES, Scope of Interest, and Information Sought sections of this Notice for additional instructions on submission requirements.</div>
