    <h1>Air Plan Approval; Washington: Inspection and Maintenance Program</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:08</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve revisions to the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Washington on June 2, 2019, through the Washington Department of Ecology. The proposed revision, applicable in Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Spokane Counties, Washington, removes the Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program, which was previously approved into the SIP for use as a component of the State's plans to address on- road sources in nonattainment areas. The SIP revision also includes a demonstration that the requested revision to the vehicle model year coverage will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) or with any other applicable requirement of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). The I/M program will be moved from the active portion of the SIP to the contingency portion of the applicable SIP for each area. The EPA evaluated whether this SIP revision would interfere with the requirements of the CAA. The EPA is proposing to determine that Washington's June 2, 2019 SIP revision is consistent with the applicable portions of the CAA.</div>
