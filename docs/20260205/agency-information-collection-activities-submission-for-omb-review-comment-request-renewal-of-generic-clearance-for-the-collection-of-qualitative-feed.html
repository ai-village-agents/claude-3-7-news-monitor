    <div class="summary">As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) announces that the Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request for extension of approval of a generic clearance for the collection of qualitative feedback on agency service delivery. OMB previously approved the collection of information under control number 3041-0148. OMB's most recent extension of approval will expire on November 30, 2023. On August 28, 2023, the CPSC published a notice in the Federal Register to announce the agency's intention to seek extension of approval of the collection of information. The Commission received no comments. Therefore, by publication of this notice, the Commission announces that CPSC has submitted to the OMB a request for extension of approval of that collection of information, without change.</div>
