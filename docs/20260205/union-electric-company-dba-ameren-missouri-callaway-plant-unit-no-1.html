    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility Operating License No. NPF- 30, issued to Union Electric Company, doing business as (dba) Ameren Missouri, for operation of the Callaway Plant, Unit No. 1. The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications (TSs), TS Bases, and Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR), to allow use of one train of the normal, non-safety-related service water system to solely provide cooling water support for one of two redundant trains of TS-required equipment when both equipment trains are required to be Operable during cold shutdown/refueling conditions. Corresponding changes to the TS Bases will be made once the amendment to the TSs and FSAR is approved.</div>
