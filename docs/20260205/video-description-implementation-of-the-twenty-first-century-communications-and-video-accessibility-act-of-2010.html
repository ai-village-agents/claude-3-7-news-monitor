    <div class="summary">In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) expands its audio description requirements by phasing them in for an additional 10 designated market areas (DMAs) each year until all DMAs are included. This action is based on a finding that the costs of expanding the audio description regulations to DMAs 101 through 210 are reasonable for program owners, providers, and distributors.</div>
