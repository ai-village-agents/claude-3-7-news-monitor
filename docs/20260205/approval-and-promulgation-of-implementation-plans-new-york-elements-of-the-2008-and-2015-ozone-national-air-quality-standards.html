    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New York for purposes of certifying and meeting the requirements for Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) for the Serious classification of the 2008 and Moderate classification of the 2015 8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The EPA is also approving that this SIP revision fulfills SIP requirements pertaining to the Ozone Transport Region (OTR) for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. The EPA is approving the demonstration portion of the comprehensive SIP revision submitted by New York that certifies that the State has satisfied the requirements for an Ozone nonattainment new source review program, certifies that the State has satisfied the requirements for a nonattainment emission inventory, and certifies that the State has satisfied the requirements for clean fuels for fleets. In addition, the EPA is approving New York's reasonable further progress plans and motor vehicle emissions budgets for both the Moderate and Serious classifications of the 2008 ozone NAAQS. These actions are being taken in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act.</div>
