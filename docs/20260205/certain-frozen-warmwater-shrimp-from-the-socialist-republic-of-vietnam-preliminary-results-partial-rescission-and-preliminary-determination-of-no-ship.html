    <div class="summary">The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily determines that no companies under review qualify for a separate rate and that these companies are, therefore, considered part of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam)-wide entity. Additionally, Commerce is partially rescinding this review with respect to companies for which all review requests were timely withdrawn. Further, Commerce preliminary determines that certain companies had no shipments of subject merchandise during the period of review (POR), February 1, 2022, through January 31, 2023. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.</div>
