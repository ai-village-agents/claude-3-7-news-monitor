    <h1>Notice of Allocation Availability (NOAA) Inviting Applications for the Calendar Year (CY) 2021 Allocation Round of the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:50</div>
    <div class="summary">This NOAA is issued in connection with the CY 2021 allocation round (Allocation Round) of the New Markets Tax Credit Program (NMTC Program), as authorized by Title I, subtitle C, section 121 of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-554) as amended. Through the NMTC Program, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) provides authority to certified CDEs to offer an incentive to investors in the form of tax credits over seven years, which is expected to stimulate the provision of private investment capital that, in turn, will facilitate economic and community development in Low-Income Communities. Through this NOAA, the CDFI Fund announces the availability of $5 billion of NMTC Allocation authority in this Allocation Round. In this NOAA, the CDFI Fund specifically addresses how a CDE may apply to receive an allocation of NMTCs, the competitive procedure through which NMTC Allocations will be made, and the actions that will be taken to ensure that proper allocations are made to appropriate entities.</div>
