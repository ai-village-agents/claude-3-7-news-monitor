    <div class="summary">The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is implementing the Semiconductor Technology Pilot Program, which is designed to accelerate improvements in the semiconductor industry by expediting examination of patent applications for certain semiconductor manufacturing innovations. The pilot program is intended to encourage research, development, and innovation in the semiconductor manufacturing space and provide equitable intellectual property protection to incentivize investments in the semiconductor manufacturing area. Expediting examination of patent applications directed to semiconductor manufacturing under this pilot program encourages innovations that increase semiconductor device production, reduce semiconductor manufacturing costs, and strengthen the semiconductor supply chain. Applications accepted into the pilot program will be advanced out of turn (accorded special status) for examination until a first Office action is issued. This notice outlines the conditions, requirements, and guidelines of the pilot program.</div>
