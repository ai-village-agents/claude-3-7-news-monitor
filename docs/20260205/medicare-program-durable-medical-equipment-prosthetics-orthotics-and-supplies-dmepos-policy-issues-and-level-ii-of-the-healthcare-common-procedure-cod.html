    <h1>Medicare Program; Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Policy Issues and Level II of the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:09</div>
    <div class="summary">This proposed rule would establish methodologies for adjusting the Medicare durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) fee schedule amounts using information from the Medicare DMEPOS competitive bidding program for items furnished on or after April 1, 2021, or the date immediately following the duration of the emergency period described in section 1135(g)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act, whichever is later; application evaluation processes and other procedures related to Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II code applications; and procedures for making benefit category and payment determinations for new items and services that are durable medical equipment (DME), prosthetic devices, orthotics and prosthetics, therapeutic shoes and inserts, surgical dressings, or splints, casts, and other devices used for reductions of fractures and dislocations under Medicare Part B. In addition, this rule proposes to classify continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) as DME under Medicare Part B and establish fee schedule amounts for these items and related supplies and accessories. Also, this proposed rule would expand the scope of the Medicare Part B benefit for DME by revising the interpretation of the "appropriate for use in the home" requirement in the definition of DME specifically for certain drugs or biologicals infused in the home using an external infusion pump. This proposed rule would also make conforming changes to the regulations related to implementation of section 106 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.</div>
