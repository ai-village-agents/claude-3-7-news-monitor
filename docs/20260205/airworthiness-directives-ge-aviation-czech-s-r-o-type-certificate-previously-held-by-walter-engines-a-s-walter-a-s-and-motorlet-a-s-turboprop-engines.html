    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (Type Certificate Previously Held by WALTER Engines a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Turboprop Engines</h1>

    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E- 11AS, M601E-11S, M601F, H75-200, H80-100, H80-200, and H85-200 model turboprop engines. This AD was prompted by reports of engine power fluctuations occurring during ground tests. This AD requires the removal and replacement of the fuel control unit (FCU). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
