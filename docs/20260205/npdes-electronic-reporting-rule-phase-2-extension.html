    <h1>NPDES Electronic Reporting Rule-Phase 2 Extension</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:55</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing this final rule to postpone the compliance deadlines for implementation of Phase 2 of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Electronic Reporting Rule ("NPDES eRule"). The NPDES eRule requires EPA and states to modernize Clean Water Act (CWA) reporting. This final rule also provides states with additional flexibility to request additional time as needed. Further, this final rule promulgates clarifying changes to the NPDES eRule and eliminates some duplicative or outdated reporting requirements. Taken together, these changes are designed to save the NPDES authorized programs considerable resources, make reporting easier for NPDES-regulated entities, streamline permit renewals, ensure full exchange of NPDES program data between states and EPA, enhance public transparency, improve environmental decision- making, and protect human health and the environment.</div>
