    <h1>Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; Updated Regulations in Light of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019, and for Other Purposes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:30:41</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is issuing proposed rules to implement technical changes to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP or Program) required by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (2019 Reauthorization Act), and to update links to the Program's website, where additional information relating to the administration of the Program is located for public reference. In addition, Treasury is proposing rules to: Clarify the manner in which Treasury will calculate "property and casualty insurance losses" for purposes of considering certification of an act of terrorism, and "insured losses" when administering the financial sharing mechanisms under the Program, including the Program Trigger and Program Cap; and incorporate into the Program rules prior guidance provided by Treasury in connection with stand-alone cyber insurance under the Program. Treasury also seeks further public comment concerning the certification process under the Program, and the participation of captive insurers in the Program, to facilitate further analysis and study by the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) of the Program and potential future rulemakings in these areas.</div>
