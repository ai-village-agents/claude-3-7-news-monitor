    <div class="summary">The Administrator has adopted the attached Final Power Marketing Policy for the Jim Woodruff System Project. The policy will be effective thirty days after publication in the Federal Register. The policy was developed in accordance with Southeastern's Procedure for Public Participation in the Formulation of Marketing Policy published July 6, 1978, pursuant to a notice of intent to formulate a power marketing policy published in the Federal Register of August 5, 2022, and a proposed policy published in the Federal Register of April 7, 2023. A public comment forum was held via a virtual web based meeting on June 8, 2023. Comments were due on or before June 23, 2023. Twelve comments were received relative to the proposed policy. The Administrator appointed a Staff Committee to prepare a Staff Evaluation of all oral and written comments and responses received by Southeastern and to make appropriate recommendations. The Staff Evaluation was completed on Sept 5, 2023. Following the Staff Evaluation, the Administrator decided to adopt the policy as modified.</div>
