    <h1>Proposed Expansion of the Red Hills Lake County Viticultural Area</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:38</div>
    <div class="summary">The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes to expand the "Red Hills Lake County" viticultural area by approximately 679 acres. The Red Hills Lake County viticultural area and the proposed expansion area are both located in Lake County, California, and are located within the established Clear Lake and North Coast viticultural areas. TTB designates viticultural areas to allow vintners to better describe the origin of their wines and to allow consumers to better identify wines they may purchase. TTB invites comments on this proposed amendment to its regulations.</div>
