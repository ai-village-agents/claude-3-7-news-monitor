    <h1>Filing Process and Data Collection for the Electric Quarterly Report</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:08</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission or FERC) proposes various changes to current Electric Quarterly Report (EQR) filing requirements, including both the method of collection and the data being collected. The proposed changes are designed to update the data collection, improve data quality, increase market transparency, decrease costs, over time, of preparing the necessary data for submission, and streamline compliance with any future filing requirements. Among other things, the Commission proposes to implement a new collection method for EQR reporting based on the eXtensible Business Reporting Language-Comma-Separated Values standard; amend its regulations to require Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators to produce reports containing market participant transaction data; and modify or clarify EQR reporting requirements.</div>
