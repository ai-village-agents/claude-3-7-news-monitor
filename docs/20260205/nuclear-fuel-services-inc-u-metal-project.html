    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying environmental assessment (EA) regarding the NRC's consideration of a license amendment request to amend a Special Nuclear Material (SNM) license, SNM-124, held by Nuclear Fuel Service, Inc. (NFS) at the NFS site located in Erwin, Tennessee. If approved, the amendment would authorize NFS to operate uranium purification and conversion services (U-Metal Project) at the NFS site, pursuant to a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. Based on the EA, the NRC staff has concluded that there will be no significant impacts to environmental resources from the requested license amendment, and therefore, a FONSI is appropriate.</div>
