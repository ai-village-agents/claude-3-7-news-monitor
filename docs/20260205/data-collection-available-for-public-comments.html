    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:48</div>
    <div class="summary">The Small Business Administration (SBA) intends to request approval, from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the collection of information described below. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 requires federal agencies to publish a notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information before submission to OMB, and to allow 60 days for public comment in response to the notice. This information collection is currently approved under emergency procedures, which includes waiver of that public comment notice. This publication complies with the PRA requirement to publish the waived notice as a prerequisite to requesting standard review and approval from OMB.</div>
