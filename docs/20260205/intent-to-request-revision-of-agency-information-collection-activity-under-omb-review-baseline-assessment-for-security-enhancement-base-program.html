    <h1>Intent To Request Revision of Agency Information Collection Activity Under OMB Review: Baseline Assessment for Security Enhancement (BASE) Program</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:50</div>
    <div class="summary">The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) invites public comment on one currently approved Information Collection Request (ICR), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number 1652-0062 abstracted below that we will submit to OMB for a revision in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). The ICR covers the assessment of current security practices in public transportation passenger rail (PTPR) and highway and motor carrier (HWY) industries by way of the Baseline Assessment for Security Enhancement (BASE) program, which encompasses site visits and interviews, and is part of the larger domain awareness, prevention, and protection program that supports the mission of TSA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This voluntary collection allows TSA to conduct transportation security- related assessments during site visits with security and operating officials of certain surface transportation modes.</div>
