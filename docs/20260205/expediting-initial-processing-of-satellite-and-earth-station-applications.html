    <h1>Expediting Initial Processing of Satellite and Earth Station Applications</h1>

    <div class="summary">In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts changes to its rules aimed at expediting the initial license application processing for satellite operators. The Commission establishes timeframes for placing satellite and earth station applications on public notice, eliminates a procedural rule that prevents consideration of requests for waiver of the International Table of Frequency Allocations, and removes the prohibition on licensed-but-unbuilt systems for non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) operators. Additionally, the Commission creates a new, streamlined processing framework for earth station operators to add satellite points of communication under certain circumstances. Finally, the Commission lays the groundwork for a broader Transparency Initiative led by the Space Bureau to provide clarity and access to applicants when interfacing with the Commission's license application processes and filing system.</div>
