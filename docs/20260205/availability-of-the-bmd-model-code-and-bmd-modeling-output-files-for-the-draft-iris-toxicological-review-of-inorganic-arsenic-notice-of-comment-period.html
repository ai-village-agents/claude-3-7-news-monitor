    <h1>Availability of the BMD Model Code and BMD Modeling Output Files for the Draft IRIS Toxicological Review of Inorganic Arsenic; Notice of Comment Period</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:47</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a public comment period on the benchmark dose (BMD) model code and BMD modeling output files associated with the Draft IRIS Toxicological Review of Inorganic Arsenic. The original Federal Register notice associated with the draft IRIS inorganic arsenic assessment was published on October 16, 2023, and closed on December 15, 2023. After reviewing the comments received on the draft assessment, EPA is opening an additional public comment period on the BMD model code and the BMD modeling output files that were not accessible by the public during the original comment period due to a technical issue. For submissions received during this public comment period, EPA will only address comments on the BMD model code and BMD modeling output files, which are available at: https://gaftp.epa.gov/EPADataCommons/ORD/ DRAFTiAsToxReview/.</div>
