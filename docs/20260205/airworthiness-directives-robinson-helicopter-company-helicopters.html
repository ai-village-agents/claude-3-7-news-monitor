    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Robinson Helicopter Company Helicopters</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:54</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22, R22 Alpha, R22 Beta, R22 Mariner, R44, R44 II, and R66 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of helicopters losing a tail rotor blade (TRB) tip cap. This proposed AD would require visually checking and inspecting certain part-numbered and serial-numbered TRB tip caps for evidence of corrosion and, depending on the results, removing the corrosion. This proposed AD would also require removing all affected TRBs from service and prohibit installing them on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
