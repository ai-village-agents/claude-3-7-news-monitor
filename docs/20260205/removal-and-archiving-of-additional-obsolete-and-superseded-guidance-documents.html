    <h1>Removal and Archiving of Additional Obsolete and Superseded Guidance Documents</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:53</div>
    <div class="summary">This notice announces that the Department has completed a second review of administrative guidance and identified guidance documents that should no longer be in effect or are deemed unnecessary and obsolete as part of the Department's implementation of Executive Order 13891, "Promoting the Rule of Law Through Improved Agency Guidance Documents." HUD is removing and archiving these documents on HUD's program websites to reduce compliance burdens, promote regulatory analysis, provide fair notice, and reduce administrative due process. The removal and archiving of these materials will make it easier for HUD constituents and members of the public to determine HUD guidance that currently applies. In some cases, documents may continue to be accessible in an online archive, such as for historical or research purposes. Guidance documents posted in an online archive shall no longer have effect and shall not be cited except to establish historical fact.</div>
