    <h1>Draft Habitat Conservation Plan and Draft Environmental Assessment for the California Department of Parks and Recreation, Oceano Dunes District, San Luis Obispo County, California</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:55</div>
    <div class="summary">We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce the availability of a draft habitat conservation plan (HCP) and associated draft environmental assessment (EA) for California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR) activities at Pismo State Beach and Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area, San Luis Obispo County, California. The CDPR developed the draft HCP as part of their application for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act. The Service prepared a draft EA in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act to evaluate the potential effects to the natural and human environment resulting from issuing an ITP to CDPR. We invite public comment on these documents.</div>
