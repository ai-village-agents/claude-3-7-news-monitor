    <h1>Findings of Failure To Submit State Implementation Plans Required for Attainment of the 2010 1-Hour Primary Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:25:51</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking a final action to find that four states and territories (Indiana, Louisiana, Guam, and Puerto Rico) failed to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to satisfy certain nonattainment area planning requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2010 1-Hour Primary Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The purpose of the development and implementation of nonattainment area SIPs is to provide for attainment of the NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable following the designation of an area as nonattainment. This action triggers certain CAA deadlines for the EPA to impose sanctions if a state or territory does not submit a complete SIP addressing the outstanding requirements and for the EPA to promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) if the EPA does not approve a state's or territory's SIP.</div>
