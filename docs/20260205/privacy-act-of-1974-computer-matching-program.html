    <div class="summary">Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protections Amendment of 1990 (Privacy Act), and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on the conduct of matching programs, notice is hereby given of the re-establishment of a matching program between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the California Department of Healthcare Services (CA-DHCS). CA-DHCS will match against DHS-USCIS data to verify the immigration status of non-U.S. citizens who apply for federal benefits (Benefit Applicants) under Medicaid programs that CA-DHCS administers to determine whether Benefit Applicants possess the requisite immigration status to be eligible for the Medicaid it administers.</div>
