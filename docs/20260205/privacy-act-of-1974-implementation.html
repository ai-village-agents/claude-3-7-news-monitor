    <h1>Privacy Act of 1974; Implementation</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:35</div>
    <div class="summary">The United States Department of Justice (DOJ or Department) is finalizing without changes its Privacy Act exemption regulations for the system of records titled, Security Monitoring and Analytics Service Records, JUSTICE/JMD-026, which were published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on July 30, 3021. Specifically, the Department's regulations will exempt the records maintained in JUSTICE/JMD-026 from one or more provisions of the Privacy Act. The exemptions are necessary to avoid interference with efforts to prevent the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information, information systems, and networks of DOJ and external Federal agency subscribers. The Department received two comments on the NPRM, neither of which impact the Department's decision to proceed with issuing this final rule.</div>
