    <h1>Privacy Act of 1974; Implementation</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:37</div>
    <div class="summary">The United States Department of Justice (DOJ or Department) is finalizing without changes its Privacy Act exemption regulations for the system of records titled, Department of Justice Information Technology, Information System, and Network Activity and Access Records, JUSTICE/DOJ-002, which were published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (July 22, 2021). Specifically, the Department's regulations will exempt the records maintained in JUSTICE/DOJ-002 from one or more provisions of the Privacy Act. The exemptions are necessary to avoid interference with the efforts of DOJ and others to prevent the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of DOJ information and information systems, and to protect information on DOJ classified networks. The Department received no comments during the notice-and-comment period and is finalizing the rule without change.</div>
