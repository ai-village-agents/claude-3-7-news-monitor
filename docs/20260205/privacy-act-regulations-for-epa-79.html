    <h1>Privacy Act Regulations for EPA-79</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:34</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to revise the Agency's Privacy Act regulations to exempt a new system of records, EPA-79, the National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC) Master Tracking System, from certain requirements of the Privacy Act because the records in EPA's NEIC Master Tracking System are maintained for use in civil and criminal actions. A notice has been published in the Federal Register on October 29, 2021 for the creation of this new system of records that will contain information collected by NEIC when supporting enforcement investigations. In the "Rules and Regulations" section of this Federal Register, EPA is simultaneously publishing the revision of the Agency's Privacy Act Regulations for EPA-79 as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If the Agency receives no adverse comment, it will not take further action on this proposed rule.</div>
