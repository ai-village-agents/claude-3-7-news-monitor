    <div class="summary">This final rule modernizes regulations regarding publication requirements of community eligibility status information under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). FEMA is replacing outdated regulations that require publication of community loss of eligibility notices in the Federal Register with a requirement that FEMA publish this information on the internet or by another comparable method. FEMA is also replacing its requirement that the agency maintain a list of communities eligible for flood insurance in the Code of Federal Regulations with a requirement that FEMA publish this list on the internet or by another comparable method.</div>
