    <h1>Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Deadline Extension for Reporting Companies Created or Registered in 2024</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:47:52</div>
    <div class="summary">FinCEN is amending the beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule (the "Reporting Rule") to extend the filing deadline for certain BOI reports. Under the Reporting Rule prior to this amendment, entities created or registered on or after the rule's effective date of January 1, 2024, had to file initial BOI reports with FinCEN within 30 calendar days of notice of their creation or registration. This amendment extends that filing deadline from 30 calendar days to 90 calendar days for entities created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, to give those entities additional time to understand the new reporting obligation and collect the necessary information to complete their filings. Entities created or registered on or after January 1, 2025, will continue to have 30 calendar days to file their BOI reports with FinCEN.</div>
