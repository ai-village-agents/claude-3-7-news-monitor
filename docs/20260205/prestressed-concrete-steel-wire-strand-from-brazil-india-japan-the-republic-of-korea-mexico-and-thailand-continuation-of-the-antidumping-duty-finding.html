    <h1>Prestressed Concrete Steel Wire Strand From Brazil, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, and Thailand: Continuation of the Antidumping Duty Finding/Orders and Countervailing Duty Order</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:30:42</div>
    <div class="summary">As a result of the determinations by the Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in their five year (sunset) reviews that revocation of the antidumping duty (AD) finding on prestressed concrete steel wire strand (PC strand) from Japan, and the AD orders on PC strand from Brazil, India, the Republic of Korea (Korea), Mexico, and Thailand (hereafter referred to as the six countries) would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury to an industry in the United States, and that revocation of the countervailing duty (CVD) order on PC strand from India would likely lead to continuation of recurrence of net countervailable subsidies and material injury to an industry in the United States, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of the AD finding/orders on PC strand from the six countries and the CVD order on PC strand from India.</div>
