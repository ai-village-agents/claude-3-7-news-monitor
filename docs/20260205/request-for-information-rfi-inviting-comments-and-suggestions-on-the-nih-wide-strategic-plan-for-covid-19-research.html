To ensure that it remains in step with public needs, this RFI invites stakeholders throughout the scientific research, advocacy, and clinical practice communities, as well as the general public to comment on the NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for COVID-19 Research. Organizations are strongly encouraged to submit a single response that reflects the views of their organization and their membership as a whole.</div>
