    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Bell Textron Canada Limited (Type Certificate Previously Held by Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited) Helicopters</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:12:28</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for Bell Textron Canada Limited (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited) Model 206L, 206L-1, 206L-3, and 206L-4 helicopters with a certain part-numbered main rotor (M/R) blade installed under Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SR02684LA. This AD was prompted by delamination of M/R blades. This AD requires a repetitive inspection for delamination, and depending on the results, removing the M/R blade from service and reporting certain information. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
