    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on October 12, 2023, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Ericsson AB of Sweden and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson of Sweden. Supplements to the Complaint were filed on October 31, 2023 and November 9, 2023. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain electronic devices, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, components thereof, and products containing the same by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,151,430 ("the '430 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,509,273 ("the '273 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 9,313,178 ("the '178 patent"); U.S. Patent No. 11,122,313 ("the '313 patent"); and U.S. Patent No. 10,972,654 ("the '654 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.</div>
