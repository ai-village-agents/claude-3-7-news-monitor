    <h1>Amended Order Implementing Presidential Proclamation on Advancing the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the COVID-19 Pandemic</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:51</div>
    <div class="summary">On October 25, 2021, the President issued a Proclamation, "Advancing the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the COVID-19 Pandemic." Pursuant to this Proclamation, the President has implemented a global suspension and restriction on entry for noncitizens who are nonimmigrants seeking to enter the United States by air travel and who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The Proclamation directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to implement the Proclamation as it applies to public health. As such, CDC announces an Amended Order implementing the Proclamation requiring noncitizens who are nonimmigrants seeking to enter the United States by air travel to provide proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to boarding an aircraft to fly to the United States, with only limited exceptions in accordance with the Proclamation. This Amended Order was signed by the CDC Director on October 30, 2021, and supersedes the previous Order signed by the CDC Director on October 25, 2021.</div>
