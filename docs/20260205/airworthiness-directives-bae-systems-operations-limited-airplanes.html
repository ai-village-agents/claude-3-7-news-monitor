    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:17</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model Avro 146-RJ series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that certain inertial reference units (IRUs) have out-of-date magnetic variation (MagVar) tables. This proposed AD would require assessing the values between the MagVar tables of the affected IRUs and the most recently published MagVar data tables, and corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
