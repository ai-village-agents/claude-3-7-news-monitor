    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an exemption in response to the February 12, 2020, request from Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI) related to Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3 (referred to individually as IP1, IP2, and IP3, respectively, and collectively as the Indian Point Energy Center or IPEC), located in Westchester County, New York. The exemption would permit HDI to use funds from the IP1, IP2, and IP3 nuclear decommissioning trusts (NDTs) for spent fuel management and site restoration activities for IP1, IP2, and IP3, respectively. The exemption would also allow such withdrawals without prior notification to the NRC. The NRC staff is issuing an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemption.</div>
