    <h1>Medicare Program; Virtual Meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee; Cancellation of the December 7, 2022 Virtual Meeting and Announcement of the February 13 and February 14, 2023 Virtual Meetings</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:03</div>
    <div class="summary">This notice announces the cancellation of the December 7, 2022 virtual public meeting of the Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC) ("Committee") that was published in the October 11, 2022 Federal Register. This notice also announces a virtual public meeting of the MEDCAC Committee on Monday, February 13 and Tuesday, February 14, 2023. National Coverage Determinations resulting in coverage with evidence development (CED) can expedite earlier Medicare beneficiary access to innovative technology while ensuring that systematic patient safeguards are in place to reduce the risks inherent to new technologies, or to new applications of older technologies. This meeting will examine the general requirements for clinical studies submitted for CMS coverage requiring CED. The MEDCAC will evaluate the CED criteria to assure that CED studies are evaluated with consistent, feasible, transparent and methodologically rigorous criteria and advise CMS on whether the criteria are appropriate to ensure that CED-approved studies will produce reliable evidence that CMS can rely on to help determine whether a particular item or service is reasonable and necessary. This meeting is open to the public in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</div>
