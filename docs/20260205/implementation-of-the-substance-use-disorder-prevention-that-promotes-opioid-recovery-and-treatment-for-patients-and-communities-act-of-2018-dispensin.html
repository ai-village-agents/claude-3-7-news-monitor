    <div class="summary">The "Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 (the SUPPORT Act)," which became law on October 24, 2018, amended the Controlled Substances Act to expand the conditions a practitioner must meet to provide medication-assisted treatment and expand the options available for a physician to be considered a qualifying physician. The SUPPORT Act removed the time period for a nurse practitioner or physician assistant to be considered a qualifying other practitioner, and revised the definition of a qualifying practitioner. The SUPPORT Act also allows a pharmacy to deliver prescribed controlled substances to a practitioner's registered location for the purpose of maintenance or detoxification treatment to be administered under certain conditions by a practitioner. The Drug Enforcement Administration amends its regulations to make them consistent with the SUPPORT Act and implement its requirements.</div>
