    <h1>Announcement of the National Customs Automation Program Test Concerning the Submission Through the Automated Commercial Environment of Certain Unique Entity Identifiers for the Global Business Identifier Evaluative Proof of Concept</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:12</div>
    <div class="summary">This document announces that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will conduct a National Customs Automation Program test regarding the electronic transmission of certain unique entity identifiers through the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). This test, which is referred to as the "Global Business Identifier Evaluative Proof of Concept" (GBI EPoC), is for participation by entry filers (i.e., importers of record and licensed customs brokers) for merchandise imported into the United States. Test participants will voluntarily provide specific global business identifiers (GBIs) for the manufacturers, sellers, and shippers of merchandise covered by specified types of entries, which are limited for purposes of this test to certain commodities and countries of origin. Test participants may also, optionally, provide specific GBIs for exporters, distributors, and packagers associated with the covered entries. The test will permit CBP and certain Partner Government Agencies (PGAs) to access the underlying data associated with the GBIs (referred to as the "GBI data"), to determine whether the submission of GBIs at the time of entry filing will enable the enhanced tracing of the supply chains of certain commodities. This notice invites importers of record and licensed customs brokers to participate in the test, provides a description of the test, sets forth the criteria for participation, and invites public comments on all aspects of the test.</div>
