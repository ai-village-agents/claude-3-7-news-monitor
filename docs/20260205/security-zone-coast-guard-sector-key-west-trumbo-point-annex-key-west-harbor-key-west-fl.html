    <div class="summary">The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a security zone for certain waters of the Key West Harbor surrounding the Coast Guard Sector Key West on Trumbo Point Annex. This action is necessary to safeguard Coast Guard assets in the interest of national security. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the security zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Key West or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.</div>
