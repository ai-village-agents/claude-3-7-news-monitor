    <div class="summary">The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) is correcting the dates announced in a document that appeared in the Federal Register on August 28, 2020. That document announced that compliance with specific sections of the Commission rules will not be required until the Commission publishes a document in the Federal Register announcing the compliance date. This document corrects the list of rule provisions subject to this compliance date. In addition, this document revises a section of the Commission's rules to advise that compliance is not required until after OMB approval of the information collection and recordkeeping requirements.</div>
