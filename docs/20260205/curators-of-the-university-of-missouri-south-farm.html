    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and accompanying Environmental Assessment (EA) for the unrestricted release of the Curators of the University of Missouri South Farm site located in Columbia, Missouri. Based on the analysis in the EA, the NRC staff has concluded that there would be no significant impacts to environmental resources from the proposed unrestricted release and, therefore, a FONSI is appropriate.</div>
