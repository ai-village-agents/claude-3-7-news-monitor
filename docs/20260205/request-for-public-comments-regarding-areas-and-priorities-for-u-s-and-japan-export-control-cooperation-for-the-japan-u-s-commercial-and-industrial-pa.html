    <div class="summary">The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) requests public comments regarding areas and priorities for U.S. and Japan export control cooperation to help inform the work of the Japan-U.S. Commercial and Industrial Partnership (JUCIP) Export Control Working Group. Comments should address ways in which existing U.S. and/or Japanese dual-use export control policies and practices may be more transparent, more efficient and effective, and more convergent, including in identifying and controlling emerging or foundational technologies, and in better facilitating research collaboration between Japan and U.S. research organizations.</div>
