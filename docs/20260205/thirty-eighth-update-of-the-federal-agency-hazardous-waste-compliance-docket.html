    <h1>Thirty-Eighth Update of the Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:32</div>
    <div class="summary">Since 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has maintained a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket ("Docket") under section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Section 120(c) requires EPA to establish a Docket that contains certain information reported to EPA by Federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which a reportable quantity of hazardous substances has been released. As explained further below, the Docket is used to identify Federal facilities that should be evaluated to determine if they pose a threat to public health or welfare and the environment and to provide a mechanism to make this information available to the public. This notice identifies the Federal facilities not previously listed on the Docket and identifies Federal facilities reported to EPA since the last update on April 29, 2020. In addition to the list of additions to the Docket, this notice includes a section with revisions of the previous Docket list and a section of Federal facilities that are to be deleted from the Docket. Thus, the revisions in this update include eight additions, six deletions, and zero corrections to the Docket since the previous update. At the time of publication of this notice, the new total number of Federal facilities listed on the Docket is 2,380.</div>
