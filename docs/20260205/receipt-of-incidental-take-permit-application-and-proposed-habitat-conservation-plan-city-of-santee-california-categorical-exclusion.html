    <h1>Receipt of Incidental Take Permit Application and Proposed Habitat Conservation Plan, City of Santee, California; Categorical Exclusion</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:18</div>
    <div class="summary">We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of an application from Mr. Louis Jutras (applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The applicant requests the ITP to take the federally threatened coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica) incidental to construction of the Jutras residential home project, in the City of Santee, San Diego County, California. We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's proposed habitat conservation plan (HCP), and the Service's preliminary determination that the proposed permitting action may be eligible for a categorical exclusion pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the Department of the Interior's (DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI Departmental Manual. To make this preliminary determination, we prepared a draft environmental action statement and low-effect screening form, both of which are also available for public review. We invite comment from the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies.</div>
