    <div class="summary">The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) seeks input on changes to its regulations governing the discretionary acquisition of land into trust for the benefit of tribal governments and individual Indians. Since these regulations were first promulgated in 1980, the BIA has developed extensive experience in the fee-to-trust acquisition process. Relying on that experience and input from tribal governments and individual Indians, this proposed rule seeks to make the land into trust process more efficient, simpler, and less expensive to support restoration of tribal homelands.</div>
