    <h1>Fees for Sanitation Inspection of Cruise Ships</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:12</div>
    <div class="summary">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces fees for vessel sanitation inspections for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023. These inspections are conducted by HHS/CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP). VSP helps the cruise ship industry fulfill its responsibility for developing and implementing comprehensive sanitation programs to minimize the risk for acute gastroenteritis. Every vessel that has a foreign itinerary and carries 13 or more passengers is subject to twice-yearly unannounced operations inspections and, when necessary, reinspection.</div>
