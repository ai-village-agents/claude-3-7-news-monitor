    <div class="summary">In accordance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service (together, the Services), announce the availability of a final environmental impact statement (FEIS) and habitat conservation plan (HCP) addressing covered activities by the Deschutes Basin Board of Control (DBBC)'s eight- member irrigation districts, and the City of Prineville (applicants). The applicants are seeking incidental take permits (ITPs) covering the incidental take of four covered species over a 30-year period. The HCP describes the steps the applicants will take to minimize, mitigate, and monitor the impacts of incidental take of the covered species. The FEIS has been prepared, pursuant to NEPA, in response to these applications.</div>
