    <h1>Requirement for Airlines and Operators To Collect and Transmit Designated Information for Passengers and Crew Arriving Into the United States; Requirement for Passengers To Provide Designated Information</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:36</div>
    <div class="summary">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the requirement for all airlines and operators to collect and/or maintain passenger and crew contact information (designated information), and for passengers to provide such information to airlines and operators, on flights arriving into the United States. This includes flights with intermediate stops in the United States between the flight's foreign point of origin and the final destination. Unless otherwise transmitted to the U.S. Government via established U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data systems, airlines and operators are required to retain the designated information for 30 days and transmit it within 24 hours of a request from CDC. Accurate and complete contact information is needed to protect the health of travelers and U.S. communities and for the purposes of public health follow-up.</div>
