    <h1>Hours of Service: Clym Environmental; Application for Exemption</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:33</div>
    <div class="summary">FMCSA announces that Clym Environmental Services LLC (Clym) has requested an exemption from the hours-of-service (HOS) regulations to allow its drivers up to 14 hours of drive time within the work shift or, in the alternative, up to 12 hours. Clym indicates that, due to the nature of its operations, complying with the 11-hour driving time limit in the HOS regulations places a strain on the company's drivers and its overall operating costs. Clym asserts that the exemption would allow additional flexibility while maintaining an equivalent level of safety. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.</div>
