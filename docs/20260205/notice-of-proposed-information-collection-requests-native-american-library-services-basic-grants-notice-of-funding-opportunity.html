    <h1>Notice of Proposed Information Collection Requests: Native American Library Services Basic Grants Notice of Funding Opportunity</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:13</div>
    <div class="summary">The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the general public and federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. This pre-clearance consultation program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. The purpose of this Notice is to communicate our intent to request renewal of the clearance for IMLS's Native American Library Services Basic Grants, a discretionary grant program designed to assist Native American tribes in improving library services for their communities. A copy of the proposed information collection request can be obtained by contacting the individual listed below in the ADDRESSES section of this Notice.</div>
