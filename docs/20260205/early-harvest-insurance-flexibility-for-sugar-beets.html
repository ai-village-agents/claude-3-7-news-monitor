    <h1>Early Harvest Insurance Flexibility for Sugar Beets</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:34</div>
    <div class="summary">The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is amending the Common Crop Insurance Regulations, Sugar Beet Crop Insurance Provisions. This rule makes the early harvest adjustment an option, providing producers with maximum flexibility to tailor their insurance policy to meet the unique risk management needs of their operation. This rule also incorporates comments to improve the early harvest adjustment that were received on a prior final rule amending the Sugar Beet Crop Insurance Provisions, published in the Federal Register on November 29, 2019. The changes will be effective for the 2024 and succeeding crop years for counties with a contract change date on or after November 30, 2023, and for the 2025 and succeeding crop years for counties with a contract change date prior to November 30, 2023.</div>
