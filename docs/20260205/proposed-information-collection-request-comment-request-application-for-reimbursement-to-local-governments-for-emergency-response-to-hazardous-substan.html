    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to submit an information collection request (ICR), Application for Reimbursement to Local Governments for Emergency Response to Hazardous Substance Releases under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Section 123 (Renewal) (EPA ICR Number 1425.12, OMB Control Number 2050-0077) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Before doing so, the EPA is soliciting public comments on specific aspects of the proposed information collection as described in Supplementary Information. This is a proposed extension of the ICR, which is currently approved through May 31, 2022. An Agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</div>
