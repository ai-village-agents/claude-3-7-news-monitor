    <h1>Submission for OMB Review; Data Collection for the Integrating Financial Capability and Employment Services Project (New Collection)</h1>

    <div class="summary">The Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is proposing a data collection activity as part of the Integrating Financial Capability and Employment Services Project. The objective of this project is to better understand financial capability interventions offered in the context of delivering employment and training services for low-income adults. This descriptive study intends to use this information to build more evidence about the extent, forms, and practices of incorporating financial capability interventions into organizations delivering employment and training services for low-income adult populations, and to help establish a basis for future research and evaluation in this area. This project will focus on organizations delivering employment and training services that also offer financial capability services to low-income adults.</div>
