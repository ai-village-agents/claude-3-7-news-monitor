    <h1>Authorization To Manufacture and Distribute Postage Evidencing Systems</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:18:54</div>
    <div class="summary">The Postal Service is amending its Postage Evidencing Systems regulations to ensure compliance for Automated Clearinghouse or ACH payment transactions and to clarify obligations related to all payments. These changes require the applicable resetting company (RC) and PC Postage provider to comply with the latest NACHA rules published by the North American Clearing House Association for ACH transactions. These responsibilities include providing a written statement signed by an executive officer of the company attesting to that compliance at least annually. These changes also require the applicable RC and PC Postage provider to obtain and store an agreement with each customer utilizing ACH debit as a payment method. Failure to comply may result in revocation of access to applicable Postal Service ACH programs.</div>
