    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Honda Aircraft Company LLC Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:13</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Honda Aircraft Company LLC (Honda) Model HA-420 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report that the flap pushrod assemblies are susceptible to corrosion. This AD requires removing and cleaning the inner diameter of the flap control pushrods and repetitively applying corrosion inhibiting compound (CIC) to this area. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
