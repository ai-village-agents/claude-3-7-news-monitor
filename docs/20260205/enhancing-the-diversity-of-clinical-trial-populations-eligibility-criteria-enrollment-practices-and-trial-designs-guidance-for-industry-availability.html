    <h1>Enhancing the Diversity of Clinical Trial Populations-Eligibility Criteria, Enrollment Practices, and Trial Designs; Guidance for Industry; Availability</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:30:41</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Enhancing the Diversity of Clinical Trial Populations--Eligibility Criteria, Enrollment Practices, and Trial Designs." This guidance recommends approaches that sponsors of clinical trials intended to support a new drug application or a biologics license application can take to increase enrollment of underrepresented populations in their clinical trials. This guidance is being issued, in part, to satisfy the mandates of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA). This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued on June 7, 2019.</div>
