    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Defense and Space S.A. (Formerly Known as Construcciones Aeronauticas, S.A.) Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 10:30:39</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Defense and Space S.A. Model CN-235, CN-235-100, CN-235- 200, CN-235-300 airplanes and Model C-295 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by cracks found on certain left- and right-hand stringers in a certain area of the fuselage. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections for cracking or broken rivets of certain left- and right-hand stringers and surrounding structure, and repair if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
