    <h1>Framework for Conditional Sailing and Initial Phase COVID-19 Testing Requirements for Protection of Crew</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:10</div>
    <div class="summary">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces a framework for a phased resumption of cruise ship passenger operations. CDC also announces requirements for the initial phases of this framework regarding testing of crew members for COVID-19, an integral part of the initial phases prior to resuming passenger operations. This Order applies to cruise ship operators with cruise ships operating in U.S. waters and cruise ship operators who are operating cruise ships outside of U.S. waters, but intend for their cruise ships to return to operating in U.S. waters while this Order remains in effect.</div>
