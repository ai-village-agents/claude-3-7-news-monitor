    <h1>Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Isotonitazene in Schedule I</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:39</div>
    <div class="summary">With the issuance of this final order, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is permanently placing N,N-diethyl- 2-(2-(4-isopropoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)ethan-1-amine (commonly known as isotonitazene), including its isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of isomers, esters, and ethers whenever the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers, and salts is possible within the specific chemical designation, in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. This scheduling action discharges the United States' obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961). This action continues to impose the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research or conduct instructional activities with, or possess), or propose to handle isotonitazene.</div>
