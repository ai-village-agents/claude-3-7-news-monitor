    <div class="summary">Section 110(h) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, requires EPA to assemble the requirements of the federally-enforceable State Implementation Plans (SIPs) in each State and to provide notification in the Federal Register of the availability of such documents every three years. This document fulfills the three-year requirement of making these SIP compilations for each State available to the public. This document also addresses EPA's obligation under a consent decree which required EPA to assemble and publish online the SIP rules that have been approved by EPA as of August 31, 2022.</div>
