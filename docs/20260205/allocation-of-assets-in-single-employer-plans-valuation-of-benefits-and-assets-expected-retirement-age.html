    <h1>Allocation of Assets in Single-Employer Plans; Valuation of Benefits and Assets; Expected Retirement Age</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:48:02</div>
    <div class="summary">This rule amends the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's regulation on Allocation of Assets in Single-Employer Plans by substituting a new table for determining expected retirement ages for participants in pension plans undergoing distress or involuntary termination with valuation dates falling in 2024. This table is needed to compute the value of early retirement benefits and, thus, the total value of benefits under a plan.</div>
