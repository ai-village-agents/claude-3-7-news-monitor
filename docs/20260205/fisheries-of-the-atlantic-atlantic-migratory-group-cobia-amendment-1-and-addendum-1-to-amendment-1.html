    <h1>Fisheries of the Atlantic; Atlantic Migratory Group Cobia; Amendment 1 and Addendum 1 to Amendment 1</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:37</div>
    <div class="summary">NMFS issues regulations related to Amendment 1, and Addendum 1 to Amendment 1, to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Atlantic Migratory Group Cobia (Interstate FMP), as prepared and submitted by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). As described in Amendment 1 and Addendum 1, this final rule revises the commercial quota and the process for a commercial quota closure for Atlantic migratory group cobia (Atlantic cobia) in Federal waters. The purpose of this final rule is to increase the commercial quota as a result of the most recent stock assessment and to allow the ASMFC to monitor commercial landings for any needed commercial in-season closure while ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Atlantic cobia stock.</div>
