    <h1>Implementation of Fish and Fish Product Import Provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act-Notification of Rejection of Petition and Issuance of Comparability Findings</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:40</div>
    <div class="summary">Under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the NMFS Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (Assistant Administrator) has denied a petition for emergency rulemaking from Sea Shepherd Legal. Additionally, the Assistant Administrator has issued comparability findings for the Government of New Zealand's (GNZ) following fisheries: West Coast North Island multi-species set net fishery, and West Coast North Island multi-species trawl fishery. NMFS bases the comparability findings on documentary evidence submitted by the GNZ and other relevant, readily-available information including the scientific literature.</div>
