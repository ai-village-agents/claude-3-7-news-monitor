    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:36</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gain insights from interested parties about establishing a resource center that supports State and local Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) agencies in improving the WIC application and certification journey. This is a request for information that may inform a future cooperative agreement. It is not a solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. The purpose of this notice is to: 1. Determine the level of interest that exists for the proposed service; 2. Obtain information about the approach to providing the service, including needs, capabilities, and requirements; and 3. Gather information on the potential constraints and risks associated with this approach. Information gathered through this RFI may be used to inform potential strategies for supporting and improving State and local WIC operations. FNS welcomes comments from all stakeholders.</div>
