    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Honeywell International Inc. Engines</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:57</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) Model AS907-1-1A and AS907-2- 1G engines. This AD was prompted by reports of compressor surge, including a dual engine compressor surge, during takeoff climb out through a steep temperature inversion, causing a loss of engine thrust control. This AD requires either the replacement of a certain electronic control unit (ECU) software version installed on AS907-1-1A engines with updated software or the replacement of certain ECUs installed on AS907-1-1A engines with ECUs eligible for installation. This AD also requires the replacement of certain ECUs installed on AS907-2-1G engines. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
