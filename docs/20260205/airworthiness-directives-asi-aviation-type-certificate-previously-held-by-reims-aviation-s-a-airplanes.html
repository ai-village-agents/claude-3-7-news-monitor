    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; ASI Aviation (Type Certificate Previously Held by Reims Aviation S.A.) Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:50</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all ASI Aviation (type certificate previously held by Reims Aviation S.A.) Model F406 airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as failure of a circuit breaker (CB) switch. This AD requires replacing certain CB switches and establishing a life limit for the CB switches. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
