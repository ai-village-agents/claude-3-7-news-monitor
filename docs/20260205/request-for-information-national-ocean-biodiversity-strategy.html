    <h1>Request for Information: National Ocean Biodiversity Strategy</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:27:57</div>
    <div class="summary">The National Science Foundation, on behalf of the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology (SOST), requests input from all interested parties to inform the development of a National Ocean Biodiversity Strategy (Strategy), covering the genetic lineages, species, habitats, and ecosystems of United States (U.S.) ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters. The Strategy will strengthen the knowledge foundation and coordination on which federal agencies and other parties can align priorities and investments toward more cost-effective and successful solutions to the increasing challenges that require information on biodiversity and living resources. The Strategy will align research and monitoring on ocean life for safe and sustainable management, conservation, development, and climate solutions; and improve delivery of biodiversity information to support wise management and the growing ocean economy. Through this request for information (RFI), SOST seeks input on the foundational elements of a Strategy for delivering needed knowledge and implementing effective stewardship of ocean life. Those elements will include actions federal agencies should take to collect, coordinate, and deliver information for policy, investment, development, and management, to better align ocean biodiversity investments and policy with societal needs for both use and protection of living resources, ensuring benefits to society across sectors and from local to international levels.</div>
