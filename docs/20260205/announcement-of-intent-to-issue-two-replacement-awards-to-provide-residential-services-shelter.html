    <h1>Announcement of Intent To Issue Two Replacement Awards To Provide Residential Services (Shelter)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:49</div>
    <div class="summary">ACF, ORR announces the intent to award two Replacement Awards in the amount of up to $77,496,593 to BCFS Health and Human Services in Los Fresnos, Texas. On September 17, 2021, Comprehensive Health Services, LLC (CHS) relinquished two federally funded discretionary grants. Per HHS policy, ORR identified the current recipient BCFS Health and Human Services to transfer the current permanent capacity to provide shelter for apprehensions of Unaccompanied Children (UC) at the Southwest Border. The continuation of permanent capacity is a prudent step to ensure that ORR is able to meet its responsibility, by law, to provide shelter and appropriate services for UC referred to its care by the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of this award is to ensure the continuation of residential services for the capacity of 560 shelter beds for UC.</div>
