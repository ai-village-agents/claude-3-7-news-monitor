    <div class="summary">The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services seeks approval to collect information to explore the role of Head Start in the early care and education (ECE) financing landscape, as well as how the use of multiple funding sources within a single Head Start program may be associated with the provision of Head Start's comprehensive services and with state-level differences in ECE funding. Survey data will be collected from Head Start program directors and state government administrators.</div>
