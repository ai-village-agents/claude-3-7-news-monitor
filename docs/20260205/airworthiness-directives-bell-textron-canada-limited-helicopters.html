    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Bell Textron Canada Limited Helicopters</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:12:28</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 505 helicopters. This AD was prompted by the discovery of a potential fouling condition between the rotating swashplate outer ring and the non-rotating collective lever. This AD requires inspecting the collective control system rigging and depending on the results, rigging the collective and cyclic control systems, as specified in a Transport Canada emergency AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also requires reporting certain information. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
