    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting nominations for voting members to serve on the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC) in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Nominations will be accepted for current and upcoming vacancies effective January 1, 2023, with this notice. FDA seeks to include the views of women and men, members of all racial and ethnic groups, and individuals with and without disabilities on its advisory committees and, therefore, encourages nominations of appropriately qualified candidates from these groups.</div>
