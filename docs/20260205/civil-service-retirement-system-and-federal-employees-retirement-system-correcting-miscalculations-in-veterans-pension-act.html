    <h1>Civil Service Retirement System and Federal Employees Retirement System; Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans' Pension Act</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:02</div>
    <div class="summary">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing this proposed rule to implement the provisions of the "Correcting Miscalculations in Veterans' Pensions Act." This Act provides authority for agencies and OPM to pay, at their discretion, interest on certain deposits (post-1956 military service deposits and service credit deposits for voluntary service with the Peace Corps and Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)) when additional interest is assessed due to administrative error. Agencies need to establish their own guidelines for waiver, subject to funding limitations that may prevent reimbursement by the agency. These regulations also pertain to payments made by OPM with regard to service credit deposits for volunteer service.</div>
