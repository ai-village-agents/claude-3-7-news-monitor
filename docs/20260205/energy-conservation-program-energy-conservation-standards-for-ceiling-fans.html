    <h1>Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Ceiling Fans</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:42</div>
    <div class="summary">The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products, including ceiling fans. The Energy Act of 2020 amended the energy conservation standards for large-diameter ceiling fans ("LDCFs"). DOE codified these efficiency requirements in a final rule published May 27, 2021. When DOE published the final rule codifying the standards for LDCFs in 2021, DOE's test procedure for LDCFs was applicable only to those ceiling fans with a diameter less than or equal to 24 feet. As a result, DOE could not implement the full scope of LDCF standards set forth in the Energy Act of 2020. In order to remedy this situation, DOE has removed this limit on ceiling fan diameter in the most recent test procedure rulemaking for ceiling fans. As such, DOE is now able to implement in this final rule the full scope of standards for LDCFs set forth in the Energy Act of 2020.</div>
