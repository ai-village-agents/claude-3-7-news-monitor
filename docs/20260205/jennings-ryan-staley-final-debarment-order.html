    <h1>Jennings Ryan Staley: Final Debarment Order</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:33</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Jennings Ryan Staley for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Staley was convicted of one felony count under Federal law for Importation Contrary to Law. The factual basis supporting Mr. Staley's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Staley was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. Mr. Staley provided notice to FDA that he acquiesced to the debarment; FDA received that notice on October 6, 2022. As such, his debarment commenced on the date FDA was notified of acquiescence.</div>
