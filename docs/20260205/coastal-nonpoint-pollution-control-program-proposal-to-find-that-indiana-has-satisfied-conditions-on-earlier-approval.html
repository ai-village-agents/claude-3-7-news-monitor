    <h1>Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program: ProposaL To Find That Indiana Has Satisfied Conditions on Earlier Approval</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:48:11</div>
    <div class="summary">The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (the Federal agencies) invite public comment on the Federal agencies' proposed finding that Indiana has satisfied all conditions the agencies established as part of their 2008 approval of the state's coastal nonpoint pollution control program (coastal nonpoint program). The Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments (CZARA) directs states and territories with coastal zone management programs previously approved under section 306 of the Coastal Zone Management Act to develop and implement coastal nonpoint programs, which must be submitted to the Federal agencies for approval. Prior to making such a finding, NOAA and the EPA invite public input on the two agencies' rationale for this proposed finding.</div>
