    <h1>Pell Grants for Prison Education Programs; Determining the Amount of Federal Education Assistance Funds Received by Institutions of Higher Education (90/10); Change in Ownership and Change in Control</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:12:26</div>
    <div class="summary">The Secretary amends regulations for the Federal Pell Grant program (Pell Grants or Pell), institutional eligibility, and student assistance general provisions. First, we amend the regulations for Federal Pell Grants for prison education programs (PEPs), to implement new statutory requirements to establish Pell Grant eligibility for a confined or incarcerated individual enrolled in a PEP to implement the statutory change in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Second, we amend the Title IV Revenue and Non-Federal Education Assistance Funds regulations (referred to as "90/10" or the "90/10 Rule") to implement the statutory change in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP). We further amend which non-Federal funds can be counted when determining compliance with the 90/10 rule to align allowable non- Federal revenue more closely with statutory intent. Finally, we amend regulations to clarify the process for consideration of changes in ownership and control (CIO), to promote compliance with the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and related regulations and reduce risk for students and taxpayers, as well as institutions contemplating or undergoing such a change.</div>
