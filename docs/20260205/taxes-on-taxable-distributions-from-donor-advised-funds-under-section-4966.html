    <div class="summary">This document contains proposed regulations regarding excise taxes on taxable distributions made by a sponsoring organization from a donor advised fund (DAF), and on the agreement of certain fund managers to the making of such distributions. The proposed regulations would provide guidance regarding DAFs and taxable distributions. The proposed regulations generally would apply to certain organizations, including community foundations and other charitable organizations, that maintain one or more DAFs, and to other persons involved with the DAFs, including donors, donor-advisors, related persons, and certain fund managers.</div>
