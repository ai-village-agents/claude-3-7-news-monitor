    <h1>Special Conditions: Airbus SAS Model A380-800 Series Airplanes; Electronic System Security Protection From Unauthorized External Access</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:48</div>
    <div class="summary">These special conditions are issued for Airbus SAS (Airbus) Model A380-800 series airplanes. These airplanes will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is a digital systems architecture with several connected networks that will allow access from external sources (e.g., operator networks, wireless devices, internet connectivity, service provider satellite communications, electronic flight bags, etc.) to the airplane's internal electronic components. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.</div>
