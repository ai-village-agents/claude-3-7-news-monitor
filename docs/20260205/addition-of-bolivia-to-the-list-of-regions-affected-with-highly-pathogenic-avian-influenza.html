    <h1>Addition of Bolivia to the List of Regions Affected With Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:48:02</div>
    <div class="summary">We are advising the public that we added Bolivia to the list of regions that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service considers to be affected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). This action follows our imposition of HPAI-related restrictions on the importation of avian commodities originating from or transiting Bolivia as a result of the confirmation of HPAI in that country.</div>
