    <div class="summary">NMFS issues this notice to inform the public that there will be a decrease of the fee rate required to repay the reduction loan financing the non-pollock groundfish fishing capacity reduction program. Effective January 1, 2023, NMFS is decreasing the Loan A fee rate to $0.020 per pound to ensure timely repayment of the loan. The fee rate for Loan B will remain unchanged at $0.001 per pound. The decreased fee rate is due to the 15 percent increase in non-pollock groundfish Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for 2023 since the fee rate was raised in 2021.</div>
