    <h1>Collection or Recovery by VA for Humanitarian Care or Services and for Certain Other Care and Services</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:37</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to revise its regulations concerning reimbursement rates for health care that VA provides to individuals who are not otherwise eligible for such care as veterans or other VA beneficiaries. Specifically, this rulemaking would revise provisions of VA regulations and make them consistent with applicable law along with removing obsolete provisions. These revisions would clarify VA regulations related to the provision of VA health care to individuals who are not otherwise eligible for such care as veterans or other VA beneficiaries, and it would not substantively affect the provision of health care to eligible veterans or other VA beneficiaries.</div>
