    <h1>Renewable Fuel Standard Program: Canola Oil Pathways to Renewable Diesel, Jet Fuel, Naphtha, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and Heating Oil</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:10</div>
    <div class="summary">In this action, EPA determines that renewable diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) produced from canola/rapeseed oil via a hydrotreating process all meet the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction threshold of 50 percent required for advanced biofuels and biomass-based diesel (BBD) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Based on the analyses described in the earlier notice of proposed rulemaking associated with this action, EPA is adding these pathways to the list of approved pathways in the RFS regulations, making them eligible to generate Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), provided they satisfy the other definitional and RIN generation criteria for renewable fuel specified in the RFS regulations. EPA is also amending the RFS regulations by adding a new definition of "canola/rapeseed oil."</div>
