    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:14</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is requesting information from the public to inform VA's review of access standards for furnishing hospital care, medical services and extended care services to covered veterans, for purposes of the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP). Specifically, VA requests information regarding access standards, including but not limited to, information regarding health plans on the use of access standards for the design of health plan provider networks; referrals from network providers to out-of- network providers; the appeals process for exemptions from benefit limits to out-of-network providers; and the measurement of performance against Federal or State regulatory standards. Further, VA is requesting input on Veterans' experience with the access standards established in 2019.</div>
