    <div class="summary">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is granting an exemption to certain member firms designated by the BSE Limited (BSE) from the application of certain of the Commission's foreign futures and option regulations based upon substituted compliance with certain comparable regulatory and self-regulatory requirements of a foreign regulatory authority consistent with conditions specified by the Commission, as set forth herein. This Order is issued pursuant to Commission regulation 30.10, which permits persons to file a petition with the Commission for exemption from the application of certain of the regulations set forth in part 30 and authorizes the Commission to grant such an exemption if such action would not be otherwise contrary to the public interest or to the purposes of the provision from which exemption is sought. The Commission notes that this Order does not pertain to any transaction in swaps, as defined in Section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act (Act).</div>
