    <h1>Airworthiness Directives; Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH Airplanes</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:14:33</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH Model DA 42, DA 42 NG, and DA 42 M-NG airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as failure of the nose landing gear (NLG) actuator attachment lever and detachment from the NLG leg. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the NLG actuator attachment lever for cracks and damage and taking any necessary corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
