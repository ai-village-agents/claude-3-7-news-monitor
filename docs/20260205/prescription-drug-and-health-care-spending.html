    <div class="summary">Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the IRS is issuing temporary regulations that increase transparency by requiring group health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual markets to report information about prescription drugs and health care spending to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of the Treasury (the Departments). The IRS is issuing the temporary regulations at the same time that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Employee Benefits Security Administration of DOL, and the Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight of HHS are issuing substantially similar interim final rules with a request for comments. The text of those temporary regulations also serves as the text of these proposed regulations.</div>
