    <h1>Proposed Establishment of Class E Airspace and Proposed Amendment of Class E Airspace; Dallas, GA</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:08</div>
    <div class="summary">This action proposes to establish Class E surface airspace for Paulding Northwest Atlanta Airport (new name), Dallas, GA, as the airport now qualifies for surface airspace, and amend Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface by increasing the airport radius and updating the airport's name. Controlled airspace is necessary for the safety and management of instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in the area.</div>
