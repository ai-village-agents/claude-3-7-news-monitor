    <h1>Announcement of Intent To Issue Replacement Award To Provide Residential Services (Shelter)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:00:49</div>
    <div class="summary">ACF, ORR announces the issuance of a replacement award in the amount of up to $18,871,413 to Urban Strategies, San Benito, Texas. On September 17, 2021, Comprehensive Health Services, LLC (CHS) relinquished a federally funded discretionary grant. Per HHS policy, ORR identified the current recipient Urban Strategies to transfer the current permanent capacity to provide shelter for apprehensions of Unaccompanied Children (UC) at the Southwest Border. The continuation of permanent capacity is a prudent step to ensure that ORR is able to meet its responsibility, by law, to provide shelter and appropriate services for UC referred to its care by the Department of Homeland Security. The purpose of this award is to ensure the continuation of residential services for the capacity of 100 shelter beds for UC.</div>
