    <h1>Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Cooking Products</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:12</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") proposes to establish a test procedure for a category of cooking products, i.e., conventional cooking tops, under a proposed new appendix. The proposed test procedure would adopt the latest version of the relevant industry standard with modifications to adapt the test method to gas cooking tops, offer an optional method for burden reduction, normalize the energy use of each test cycle, include measurement of standby mode and off mode energy use, update certain test conditions, and provide certain clarifying language. This NOPR also proposes to retitle the existing cooking products test procedure for microwave ovens only. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposal.</div>
