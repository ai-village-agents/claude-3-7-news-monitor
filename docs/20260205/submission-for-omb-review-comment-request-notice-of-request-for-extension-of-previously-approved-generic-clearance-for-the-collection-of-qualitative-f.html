This collection was developed as part of a Federal Government-wide effort to streamline the process for seeking feedback from the public on service delivery. The current generic survey clearance is assigned OMB Control No. 3117-0222; it will expire on March 31, 2024. The Commission requests comments concerning the proposed information collections under section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Act; this notice describes such comments in greater detail in the supplementary information section below.</div>
