    <h1>Elimination of Copayment for Opioid Antagonists and Education on Use of Opioid Antagonists</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:16:43</div>
    <div class="summary">The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its medical regulations that govern copayments to conform with recent statutory requirements. VA would be eliminating the copayment requirement for opioid antagonists furnished to veterans who are at high risk of overdose of a specific medication or substance in order to reverse the effect of such an overdose. VA would also clarify that no copayment would be required for the provision of education on the use of opioid antagonists. This proposed rule would be an essential part of VA's attempts to help veterans at high risk of overdose.</div>
