    <div class="summary">The NCUA Board (Board) is proposing to amend the NCUA's Derivatives rule. This proposed rule is intended to modernize the NCUA's Derivatives rule and make it more principles-based. This proposal retains key safety and soundness components, while providing more flexibility for federal credit unions (FCUs) to manage their interest rate risk (IRR) through the use of Derivatives. The changes included in this proposal would streamline the regulation and expand credit unions' authority to purchase and use Derivatives for the purpose of managing IRR. This proposal also reorganizes rule content related to loan pipeline management into one section, which will aid in readability and clarity.</div>
