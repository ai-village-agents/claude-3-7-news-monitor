    <div class="summary">The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Administration for children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seeks an update to the existing data collection for the form ORR-5: Refugee Data Submission System for Formula Funds Allocations and Service Analysis (OMB#: 0970-0043, expiration 4/30/ 2024) and requests an extension of approval for three years. Minor changes to the form ORR-5 include the addition of the following two data elements: client email address and client phone number.
