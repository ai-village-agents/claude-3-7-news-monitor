    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting comment on an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) following the completion of a Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) Panel for the proposed New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units. The EPA is seeking public comment on the regulatory flexibilities considered in the IRFA. In addition, the EPA is soliciting comment on whether to include mechanisms to address potential reliability issues raised by small business and other commenters with respect to both proposed New Source Performance Standards and the proposed Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units.</div>
