    <h1>Manufacturing USA Semiconductor Institutes; Extension of Comment Period</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:09</div>
    <div class="summary">The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is extending the period for submitting comments relating to potential Manufacturing USA semiconductor institutes until December 12, 2022. In a Request for Information (RFI) that published in the Federal Register on October 13, 2022, NIST requested information to inform the design of, and requirements for, potential Manufacturing USA institutes to strengthen the semiconductor and microelectronics innovation ecosystem, which could include design, fabrication, advanced test, assembly, and packaging capability. Responses to the RFI will inform NIST's development of funding opportunities for federal assistance to establish Manufacturing USA semiconductor institutes.</div>
