    <h1>Information Blocking and the ONC Health IT Certification Program: Extension of Compliance Dates and Timeframes in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:07</div>
    <div class="summary">This interim final rule with comment period (IFC) gives health IT developers and health care providers flexibilities to effectively respond to the public health threats posed by the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recognizing the urgency of this situation, and understanding that caring for patients with COVID-19 is of utmost importance, ONC is issuing this IFC to extend certain compliance dates and timeframes adopted in the 21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program Final Rule (ONC Cures Act Final Rule), including compliance and applicability dates for the information blocking provisions, certain 2015 Edition health IT certification criteria, and Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements under the ONC Health IT Certification Program (Program). In this IFC, we are also making programmatic changes to the Program by updating standards. In addition, we are making corrections and clarifications to the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, which was published in the Federal Register on May 1, 2020.</div>
