    <h1>Amended Record of Decision for the Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:54</div>
    <div class="summary">The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi- autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is announcing this amendment to the December 19, 2008, Record of Decision (ROD) for the Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement--Operations Involving Plutonium, Uranium, and the Assembly and Disassembly of Nuclear Weapons (Complex Transformation SPEIS--2008 Programmatic ROD). In this Amended ROD, NNSA announces its programmatic decision to implement elements of a Modified Distributed Centers of Excellence (DCE) Alternative whereby NNSA would produce a minimum of 50 war reserve pits per year at a repurposed Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS) during 2030 for the national pit production mission and implement surge efforts to exceed 80 pits per year up to the analyzed limit as necessary beginning during 2030 for the nuclear weapons stockpile. This decision is supported at a programmatic level by the analysis in a Supplement Analysis (SA) to the Complex Transformation SPEIS (2019 SPEIS SA) (DOE/EIS-0236-SA-02), which NNSA prepared in 2019. After preparing and considering the 2019 SPEIS SA, NNSA has determined that no further NEPA analysis is needed at a programmatic level prior to issuing this Amended ROD.</div>
