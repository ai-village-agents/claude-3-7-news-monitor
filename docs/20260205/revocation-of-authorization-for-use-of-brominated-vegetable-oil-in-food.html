    <h1>Revocation of Authorization for Use of Brominated Vegetable Oil in Food</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 13:28:30</div>
    <div class="summary">The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend our regulations to revoke the authorization for the use of brominated vegetable oil (BVO) in food. This action is being taken because there is no longer a reasonable certainty of no harm from the continued use of BVO in food. Specifically, the proposed rule would revoke the authorization for the use of BVO as a food ingredient intended to stabilize flavoring oils in fruit-flavored beverages. There are no authorizations for other uses of BVO in food.</div>
