    <h1>Approval of Air Quality Implementation Plans; California; Sacramento Metro Area; 2008 8-Hour Ozone Nonattainment Area Requirements</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:24</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, or conditionally approve, all or portions of two state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by California to meet Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the Sacramento Metro ozone nonattainment area. These SIP revisions include the "Sacramento Regional 2008 NAAQS 8-hour Attainment and Reasonable Further Progress Plan" and the Sacramento Metro portion of the "2018 Updates to the California State Implementation Plan." Collectively, the EPA refers to these submittals as the "Sacramento Metro Area Ozone SIP." The Sacramento Metro Area Ozone SIP addresses the CAA nonattainment area requirements for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, such as the requirements for an emissions inventory, an attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures, and contingency measures, and it establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets. The EPA is proposing to approve the Sacramento Metro Area Ozone SIP as meeting all the applicable ozone nonattainment area requirements, except for the contingency measure requirement where the EPA is proposing a conditional approval. Also, the EPA is beginning the adequacy process for the 2023 and 2024 motor vehicle emissions budgets in the Sacramento Metro Area Ozone SIP via this proposed rule.</div>
