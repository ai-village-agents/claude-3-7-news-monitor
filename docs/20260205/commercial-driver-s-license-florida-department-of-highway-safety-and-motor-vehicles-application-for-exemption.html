    <h1>Commercial Driver's License: Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles; Application for Exemption</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:36:06</div>
    <div class="summary">FMCSA announces that the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV) has applied for an exemption from the commercial driver's license (CDL) skills testing regulation requiring the three-part CDL skills test to be administered and successfully completed in the following order: pre-trip inspection, basic vehicle control skills, and on-road skills. The FLHSMV is seeking an exemption to allow the tester, at their discretion, to continue testing an applicant who fails the pre-trip inspection or basic vehicle controls segments of the CDL test and allow the applicant to come back at a later date to retake the failed segment(s) only. FMCSA requests public comment on the applicant's request for exemption.</div>
