    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received an application from the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST or the applicant), to renew Special Nuclear Material (SNM) License Number 362 (SNM-362). The renewed license would authorize the applicant to continue to use SNM and other radiation sources for research and development, calibration and testing, and training activities at its campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. If the license renewal application is approved, the license would authorize NIST to continue to possess and use SNM under NRC regulations for 10 years beyond its current license.</div>
