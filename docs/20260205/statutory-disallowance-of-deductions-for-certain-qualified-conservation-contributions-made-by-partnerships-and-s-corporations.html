    <h1>Statutory Disallowance of Deductions for Certain Qualified Conservation Contributions Made by Partnerships and S Corporations</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:18:51</div>
    <div class="summary">This document contains proposed regulations concerning the statutory disallowance rule enacted by the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 to disallow a Federal income tax deduction for a qualified conservation contribution made by a partnership or an S corporation after December 29, 2022, if the amount of the contribution exceeds 2.5 times the sum of each partner's or S corporation shareholder's relevant basis. The proposed regulations would provide guidance regarding this statutory disallowance rule, including definitions, appropriate methods to calculate the relevant basis of a partner or an S corporation shareholder, the three statutory exceptions to the statutory disallowance rule, and related reporting requirements. In addition, the proposed regulations would provide reporting requirements for partners and S corporation shareholders that receive a distributive share or pro rata share of any noncash charitable contribution made by a partnership or S corporation, regardless of whether the contribution is a qualified conservation contribution (and regardless of whether the contribution is of real property or other noncash property). These proposed regulations would affect partnerships and S corporations that claim qualified conservation contributions, and partners and S corporation shareholders that receive a distributive share or pro rata share, as applicable, of a noncash charitable contribution. This document also provides a notice of public hearing on these proposed regulations.</div>
