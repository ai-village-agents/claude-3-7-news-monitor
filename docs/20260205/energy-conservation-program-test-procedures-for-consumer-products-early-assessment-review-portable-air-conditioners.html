    <h1>Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Consumer Products; Early Assessment Review: Portable Air Conditioners</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:02</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is undertaking an early assessment review to determine whether to proceed with a rulemaking to amend the test procedure for portable air conditioners ("AC"). Specifically, through this request for information ("RFI"), DOE seeks data and information that could enable the agency to determine whether DOE should propose not to amend the existing DOE test procedure because an amended test procedure would not more accurately or fully comply with the statutory requirement that the test procedure produces results that measure energy use during a representative average use cycle or period of use for the product, and not be unduly burdensome to conduct. DOE also seeks comment on the availability of consensus-based test procedures for measuring the energy use of portable ACs that more accurately or fully comply with this statutory requirement.</div>
