    <div class="summary">The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes a new system of records titled Reasonable Accommodations, Personal Assistance Services, and Medical/Religious Exceptions (SBA 42), to its inventory of records systems subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Publication of this notice complies with the Privacy Act and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-108 and Circular A-130. System of Records Notice (SORN) titled Reasonable Accommodations, Personal Assistance Services, and Medical/Religious Exceptions (SBA 42), includes current and former SBA employees, applicants for employment, and members of the public that request reasonable accommodations, personal assistance services or medical/religious exceptions. Reasonable accommodations and personal services for former and current federal employees may be requested to perform work-related duties. SBA is fully committed to providing reasonable accommodation and personal assistance services to employees and SBA applicants for employment as part of the larger effort to foster an inclusive organizational culture that empowers all employees to realize their full potential. Members of the public may request reasonable accommodations to attend SBA sponsored events or meetings and to seek information or services from SBA's programs or products. Medical/ religious exceptions may be requested by employees and SBA applicants based on a medical condition or circumstance or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance. All requests are processed through the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Civil Rights (ODI&CR).</div>
