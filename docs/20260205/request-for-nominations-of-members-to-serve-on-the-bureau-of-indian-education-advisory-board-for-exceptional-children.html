    <div class="summary">Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004 (IDEA), the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) requests nominations of individuals to serve on the Advisory Board for Exceptional Children (Advisory Board). There will be three positions available to specifically serve in the areas of Indian persons with disabilities; or State education officials; or State Interagency Coordinating Councils (for States having Indian reservations). Board members shall serve a staggered term of two or three years from the date of their appointment. The BIE will consider nominations received in response to this request for nominations, as well as other sources.</div>
