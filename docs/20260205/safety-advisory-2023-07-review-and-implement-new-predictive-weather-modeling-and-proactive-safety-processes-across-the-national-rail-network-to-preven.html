    <h1>Safety Advisory 2023-07; Review and Implement New Predictive Weather Modeling and Proactive Safety Processes Across the National Rail Network To Prevent Weather-Related Accidents and Incidents</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:10:21</div>
    <div class="summary">Since the beginning of 2021, 123 rail accidents/incidents have been reported to FRA as having been caused, in whole or in part, by severe weather conditions or weather-related events (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, flooding, mudslides, and summer heat). These extreme weather conditions and events not only present hazards to railroad workers, operations and infrastructure but can also severely impact the customers and communities relying on the railroads for travel and transportation of critical goods. To reduce weather-related accidents/incidents and improve the efficiency of the national rail network during severe weather events, FRA is issuing this Safety Advisory to recommend that railroads review existing policies, procedures, and operating rules related to predicting, monitoring, communicating, and operating during severe weather conditions or subsequent to extreme weather events. FRA also recommends that railroads collaborate to develop best practices for utilizing weather forecasting technologies, predictive weather models, and weather- related action plans throughout the industry.</div>
