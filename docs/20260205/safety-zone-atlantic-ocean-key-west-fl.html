    <div class="summary">The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone to be enforced in the event of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other disasters in the Florida Keys, FL. This action is necessary to ensure the safety of the waters of the Key West Captain of the Port (COTP) zone. This regulation establishes actions to be completed by parties operating on and around the navigable waterways of the Key West COTP zone. This may include the owners and operators, and those in management and control positions of regulated facilities, waterfront facilities, and vessels, prior to landfall of hurricanes, tropical storms, and other disasters threatening the Florida Keys.</div>
