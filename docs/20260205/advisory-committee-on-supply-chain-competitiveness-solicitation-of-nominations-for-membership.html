    <div class="summary">The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA), seeks nominations for immediate consideration to fill positions on the Advisory Committee on Supply Chain Competitiveness ("The Committee"). The Committee advises the Secretary on the necessary elements of a comprehensive policy approach to supply chain competitiveness. The Department intends for the Committee to continue to play a key role in formulating recommendations to address current global supply chain challenges, including identifying key bottlenecks in supply chains and actionable solutions to address them, advising on the latest advances in supply chain data and technology and how to apply them to the current challenges in the economy, providing advice to the Department of Commerce on its supply chain-focused work, and developing long term recommendations to make supply chains more resilient. The Department seeks members who, by virtue of their current roles and past experience, bring a track record of effective senior executive leadership on issues impacting the U.S. and global supply chains.</div>
