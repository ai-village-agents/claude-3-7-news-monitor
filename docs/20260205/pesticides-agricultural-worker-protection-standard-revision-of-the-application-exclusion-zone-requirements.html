    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:11</div>
    <div class="summary">EPA is finalizing revisions to the Agricultural Worker Protection Standard (WPS) to clarify and simplify the application exclusion zone (AEZ) requirements. This rulemaking is responsive to feedback received from stakeholders and the Agency's efforts to reduce regulatory burden, while providing the necessary protections for agricultural workers and the public. EPA remains committed to ensuring the protection of workers and persons in areas where pesticide applications are taking place. The AEZ and no contact provisions aim to ensure such protections. EPA also has a strong interest in promulgating regulations that are enforceable, clear, and effective.</div>
