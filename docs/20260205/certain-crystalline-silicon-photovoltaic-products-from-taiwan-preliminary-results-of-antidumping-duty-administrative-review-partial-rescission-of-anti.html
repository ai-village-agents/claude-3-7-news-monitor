    <h1>Certain Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Products From Taiwan: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review and Preliminary Determination of No Shipments; 2020-2021</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:15:51</div>
    <div class="summary">In response to requests from interested parties, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) is rescinding the administrative review, in part, of the antidumping duty order on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic products (solar products) from Taiwan during the period of review (POR), February 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. Specifically, Commerce is rescinding the review with respect to eleven companies under review, including the mandatory respondents, Inventec Solar Energy Corporation (ISEC) and Sino-American Silicon Products Inc. (SAS), because all requests to review these companies have been timely withdrawn. Moreover, Commerce preliminarily determines that sixteen of the companies under review made no shipments of solar products from Taiwan during the POR. Finally, with respect to the companies that did not submit no-shipment certifications and were not selected as mandatory respondents, we have determined to preliminarily apply a rate of 7.89 percent, i.e., the non-selected rate from the prior administrative review under this antidumping duty order. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.</div>
