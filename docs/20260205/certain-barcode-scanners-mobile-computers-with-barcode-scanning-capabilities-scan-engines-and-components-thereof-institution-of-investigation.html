    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:39</div>
    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on September 29, 2021, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Honeywell International Inc. of Charlotte, North Carolina; Hand Held Products, Inc. of Charlotte, North Carolina; and Metrologic Instruments, Inc. of Charlotte, North Carolina. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain barcode scanners, mobile computers with barcode scanning capabilities, scan engines, and components thereof by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,568,628 ("the '628 patent"); 7,770,799 ("the '799 patent"); 8,794,520 ("the '520 patent"); 9,576,169 ("the '169 patent"); and 10,721,429 ("the '429 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.</div>
