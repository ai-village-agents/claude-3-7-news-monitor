    <h1>Certain Semiconductor Devices Having Layered Dummy Fill, Electronic Devices, and Components Thereof; Notice of Institution of Investigation</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:32</div>
    <div class="summary">Notice is hereby given that a complaint was filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission on October 14, 2022, under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on behalf of Bell Semiconductor, LLC of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Supplements to the complaint were filed on October 25, 2022; October 31, 2022; and November 4, 2022. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain semiconductor devices having layered dummy fill, electronic devices, and components thereof by reason of the infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,396,760 ("the '760 patent"). The complaint further alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by the applicable Federal Statute. The complainant requests that the Commission institute an investigation and, after the investigation, issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders.</div>
