    <h1>Deepwater Port License Application: Blue Marlin Offshore Port, LLC (BMOP)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:17:56</div>
    <div class="summary">The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), in coordination with the Maritime Administration (MARAD), will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) as part of the environmental review of the Blue Marlin Offshore Port, LLC (BMOP) Deepwater port license application. The application proposes the ownership, construction, operation and eventual decommissioning of an offshore oil export deepwater port that would be located within and adjacent to the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in West Cameron Lease Blocks (WC) 509 and 508 and East Cameron (EC) Block 263. Following the existing Stingray pipeline, the deepwater port will be approximately 99 statute miles off the coast of Cameron Parish, Louisiana, with an approximate water depth of 162 feet. The deepwater port would allow for the loading of Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) and other sized crude oil cargo carriers via a Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring (CALM). This Notice of Intent (NOI) requests public participation in the scoping process, provides information on how to participate, and announces an informational (virtual) open house and two public meetings for the communities of Cameron Parish, Louisiana and Jefferson and Orange County, Texas. Pursuant to the criteria provided in the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (the Act), Louisiana and Texas are the designated Adjacent Coastal States for this application.</div>
