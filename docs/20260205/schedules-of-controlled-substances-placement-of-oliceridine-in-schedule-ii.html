    <div class="summary">On August 7, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug application for oliceridine, chemically known as N- [(3-methoxythiophen-2-yl)methyl] ({2-[(9R)-9-(pyridin-2-yl)-6-oxaspiro [4.5]decan-9-yl]ethyl{time} )amine fumarate. The Department of Health and Human Services provided the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) with a scheduling recommendation to place oliceridine in schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In accordance with the CSA, as revised by the Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act, DEA is hereby issuing an interim final rule placing oliceridine, including its isomers, esters, ethers, salts and salts of isomers, esters and ethers whenever the existence of such isomers, esters, ethers and salts is possible, in schedule II of the CSA.</div>
