    <div class="summary">The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-09- 15, which applied to all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000 and FALCON 2000EX airplanes. AD 2022-09-15 required relocating affected servo- valves and revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide temporary information necessary to operate airplanes fitted with at least one affected brake servo-valve. AD 2022-09-15 also limited or prohibited the installation of affected brake servo-valves. This AD was prompted by a determination that replacing certain brake servo-valves is necessary to address the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-09-15, including the parts installation limitation or prohibition, and also requires replacing an affected part with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</div>
