    <h1>Medicaid; CMS Enforcement of State Compliance With Reporting and Federal Medicaid Renewal Requirements Under Section 1902(tt) of the Social Security Act</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:35:54</div>
    <div class="summary">This interim final rule with request for comments (IFC) implements reporting requirements and enforcement authorities in the Social Security Act (the Act) that were added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (CAA, 2023). CMS will use these new enforcement authorities as described in this rule if States fail to comply with the new reporting requirements added by the CAA, 2023 or with Federal Medicaid eligibility redetermination requirements during a timeframe that is generally aligned with the period when States are restoring eligibility and enrollment operations following the end of the Medicaid continuous enrollment condition under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). The new enforcement authorities include requiring States to submit a corrective action plan, suspending disenrollments from Medicaid for procedural reasons, and imposing civil money penalties (CMPs). They also include applying a reduction to the State-specific Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for failure to meet reporting requirements.</div>
