    <h1>Certain Hardwood Plywood Products From the People's Republic of China: Notice of Court Decision Not in Harmony With the Final Determination of Antidumping Duty Investigation; Notice of Amended Determination Pursuant to Court Decision; and Notice of Revocation of Antidumping Duty Order, in Part</h1>

    <div class="summary">On October 10, 2023, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued its final judgment in Linyi Chengen Import and Export Co., Ltd., et al., v. United States, Consol. Court no. 18-00002, sustaining the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce)'s fifth remand results of redetermination pertaining to the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) antidumping duty investigation of certain hardwood plywood products (hardwood plywood) from the People's Republic of China (China). Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with Commerce's final LTFV determination. Consequently, the final antidumping duty margin calculated for mandatory respondent Linyi Chengen Import and Export Co., Ltd. (Chengen) is now zero percent and the rate assigned to the companies who received separate rates and are party to this litigation (Separate Rate Plaintiffs) is the rate assigned to Chengen, zero percent. In addition, because the final margin assigned to Chengen and the two companies that requested voluntary respondent treatment and submitted all of the threshold information necessary to be eligible for voluntary respondent treatment, Zhejiang Dehua TB Import & Export Co. (Dehua TB) and Xuzhou Jiangyang Wood Industries, Co., Ltd. (Jiangyang), is zero, Chengen, Dehua TB, and Jiangyang, in the exporter-producer combinations assigned in the investigation, are excluded from the Order.</div>
