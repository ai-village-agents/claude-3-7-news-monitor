    <h1>Proposed Amendment and Establishment of Area Navigation (RNAV) Routes T-354, and T-421; Eastern United States.</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:48</div>
    <div class="summary">This action proposes to amend United States Area Navigation (RNAV) route T-354, and establish RNAV route T-421 in the eastern United States. The proposed changes to the routes would expand the availability of RNAV routing in support of transitioning the National Airspace System (NAS) from ground-based to satellite-based navigation. Additionally, a portion of the RNAV routes would provide en route structure where VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airway segments would be removed due to VORs scheduled for decommissioning under the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program.</div>
