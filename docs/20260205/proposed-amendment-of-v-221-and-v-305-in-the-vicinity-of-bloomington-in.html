    <h1>Proposed Amendment of V-221 and V-305 in the Vicinity of Bloomington, IN</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:09</div>
    <div class="summary">The FAA is withdrawing the NPRM published in the Federal Register on June 26, 2020, proposing to amend VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal airways V-221 and V-305 due to the planned decommissioning of the VOR portion of the Hoosier, IN, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) in support of the FAA's VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program. Subsequent to the NPRM, the FAA reviewed the Hoosier VOR decommissioning project and determined additional planning meetings are necessary to ensure a more efficient implementation and integration with other ongoing program activities, and determined that withdrawal of the proposed rule is warranted.</div>
