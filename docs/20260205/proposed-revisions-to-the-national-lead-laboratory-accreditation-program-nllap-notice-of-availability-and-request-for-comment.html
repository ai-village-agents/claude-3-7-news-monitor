    <h1>Proposed Revisions to the National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP); Notice of Availability and Request for Comment</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:24:35</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting comment on proposed revisions to EPA's document titled "Laboratory Quality System Requirements (LQSR) Revision 3.0" dated November 5, 2007, under the National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP). Proposed revisions reflected in the draft document titled, "Laboratory Quality Standards for Recognition" (LQSR 4.0)," are intended to update and streamline the guidance by referencing existing laboratory standards already in practice by NLLAP participating laboratories and directly related to laboratory lead analysis, and to update the test and sampling method standards to better complement EPA's lead-based paint program activities.</div>
