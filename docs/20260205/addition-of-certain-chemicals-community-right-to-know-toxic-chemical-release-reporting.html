    <h1>Addition of Certain Chemicals; Community Right-to-Know Toxic Chemical Release Reporting</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:25</div>
    <div class="summary">In response to a petition filed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is adding 12 chemicals to the list of toxic chemicals subject to the reporting requirements under EPCRA and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA). EPA has determined that each of the 12 chemicals meets the EPCRA criteria. In addition, based on the available bioaccumulation and persistence data, EPA has determined that one chemical should be classified as a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemical and designated as a chemical of special concern with a 100-pound reporting threshold.</div>
