    <div class="summary">In this notice, OSHA announces the application of NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory Operations Contract (NOC or "the applicants") for a permanent variance and interim order from a provision of the OSHA standard that regulates commercial diving operations, presents the agency's preliminary finding on NOC's application, and announces the granting of an interim order. NOC is a team of contractors consisting of Vertex TTS, Oceaneering International Inc. (Oll), Bastion Technologies Inc., Rothe Enterprises, Rothe Development, International Preparedness Associates Inc. (IPA), MRI, and EPro. NOC's variance request is based on the conditions specified in the alternate standard that OSHA granted to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on June 30, 2021. OSHA invites the public to submit comments on the variance application to assist the agency in determining whether to grant the applicants a permanent variance based on the conditions specified in this notice.</div>
