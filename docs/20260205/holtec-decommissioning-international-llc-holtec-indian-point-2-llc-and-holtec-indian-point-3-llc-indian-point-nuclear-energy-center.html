    <div class="summary">The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of exemptions that would permit the licensee to reduce its emergency planning (EP) activities at the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, collectively referred to as the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC). Specifically, Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holtec International (Holtec) is seeking exemptions on behalf of Holtec Indian Point 2, LLC ("Holtec IP2") and Holtec Indian Point 3, LLC ("Holtec IP3"), the licensees, that would eliminate the requirements to maintain formal offsite radiological emergency plans, as well as reduce the scope of some of the onsite EP activities based on the reduced risks at IPEC, which is permanently shut down and defueled. However, requirements for an onsite radiological emergency plan and for certain onsite capabilities to communicate and coordinate with offsite response authorities would be retained. In addition, offsite EP provisions would still exist through State and local government use of a comprehensive emergency management plan process, in accordance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101, "Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans." The NRC staff is issuing an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemptions.</div>
