    <h1>Emergency Clearance: Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:07</div>
    <div class="summary">On March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to the public health emergency (PHE) caused by the SARS- CoV-2 virus, otherwise known as COVID-19. The CARES Act was published in response to the PHE that requires "every laboratory that performs or analyzes a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19 shall report the results from each such test." The September 2, 2020 interim final rule with comment (CMS- 3401-IFC) requires laboratories to report SARS-CoV-2 test results in a manner and frequency specified by the Secretary. Consistent with the CARES Act laboratory reporting requirements, CMS made modifications to the CLIA regulations to meet the SARS-CoV-2 test result reporting provisions related to the Secretary's Public Health Emergency declaration with respect to COVID-19.</div>
