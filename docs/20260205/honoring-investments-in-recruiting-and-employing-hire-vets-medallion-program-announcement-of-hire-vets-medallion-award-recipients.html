    <div class="summary">In a ceremony announcing the recipients of the 2023 HIRE Vets Medallion Awards, the Department of Labor (Department) recognized a select group of veteran-ready employers for excellence in recruiting, employing, and retaining America's veterans. The employers honored by the Department on November 8, 2023, include small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and national corporations. Recipients receive an award certificate along with a digital image of the medallion for their use, including as part of an advertisement, solicitation, business activity, or product. The awards are conferred in six categories, based on the size of the employer (small, medium, or large) and what level of criteria their application met (platinum or gold). This action announces the recipients of the 2023 and 2022 HIRE Vets Medallion Awards.</div>
