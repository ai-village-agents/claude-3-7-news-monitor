    <h1>Pesticides; Draft Guidance for Pesticide Registrants on the List of Pests of Significant Public Health Importance</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 11:29:08</div>
    <div class="summary">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on a draft Pesticide Registration Notice (PR Notice) entitled, "Draft List of Pests of Significant Public Health Importance--Revised 2020." PR Notices are issued by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to inform pesticide registrants and other interested persons about important policies, procedures, and registration related decisions, and serve to provide guidance to pesticide registrants and OPP personnel. This particular draft PR Notice provides guidance to the registrant concerning the proposal to update and replace the Pesticide Registration Notice (PRN) 2002-1, which identifies pests of significant public health importance. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that updating the list to reflect the current public health situation was warranted because vector-borne diseases and related research has changed significantly since the original PR Notice was published almost 20 years ago. This update includes the addition or removal of pests, new impacts, renaming pests, or grouping pests of similar species.</div>
