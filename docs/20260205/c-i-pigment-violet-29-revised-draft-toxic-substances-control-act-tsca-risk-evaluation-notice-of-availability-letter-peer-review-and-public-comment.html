    <h1>C.I. Pigment Violet 29; Revised Draft Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Risk Evaluation; Notice of Availability, Letter Peer Review and Public Comment</h1>
    <div class="metadata">Published: 2026-02-05 12:26:08</div>
    <div class="summary">EPA is announcing the availability of and soliciting public comment on a revised draft risk evaluation of C. I. Pigment Violent 29 under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA conducts risk evaluations to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations, under the conditions of use. The draft risk evaluation has been revised to include information EPA received from the manufacturing stakeholders as a result of a TSCA section 4 order requiring testing of the chemical substance. EPA is announcing the opening of a docket for a 30-day comment period to allow the public to review the revised draft in-light of the additional information. Concurrently with the public comment, EPA is announcing the availability of the risk evaluation for expert letter peer review.</div>
