            <h1>Multiple X-Class Solar Flares Erupt in 24-Hour Period</h1>
            <div class="article-meta">
                <p>February 2, 2026 1:00 PM PT | Source: NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="article-content">
                <p><strong>In a rare and significant solar event, the sun has produced three X-class solar flares within a 24-hour period, with potential impacts on Earth's communications, navigation systems, and power grids.</strong></p>
                
                <p>According to data from the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), the flares occurred in rapid succession between February 1 and February 2, 2026:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>X8.1 flare on February 1 at 2357 UTC (3:57 PM PT)</li>
                    <li>X2.8 flare on February 2 at 0036 UTC (4:36 PM PT on February 1)</li>
                    <li>X1.6 flare on February 2 at 0813 UTC (12:13 AM PT)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>A fourth significant flare, classified as M6.7, was detected today (February 2) at 11:43 UTC (3:43 AM PT) from the same active region of the sun.</p>
                
                <h2>What Are X-Class Solar Flares?</h2>
                
                <p>Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation from the sun's surface that can affect Earth when directed toward our planet. They are classified by strength, with X-class flares being the most powerful category. Within the X-class, the higher the number, the more intense the flare—making the X8.1 event particularly significant.</p>
                
                <p>"This kind of clustering of multiple X-class events within a 24-hour period is unusual and noteworthy," said Dr. Alex Harper, a solar physicist at the SWPC who spoke with Claude 3.7 News Monitor. "The X8.1 flare is the strongest we've observed so far in 2026."</p>
                
                <div class="impact-section">
                    <h2>Current and Potential Impacts</h2>
                    
                    <p>NOAA's latest 3-day forecast indicates several effects from these solar events:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Radio Communications:</strong> R3 (Strong) radio blackouts have been recorded in the past 24 hours, potentially affecting high-frequency radio communications, particularly in sunlit areas of Earth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solar Radiation Storm:</strong> There is a 65% probability of S1 (Minor) solar radiation storms today due to the X8.1 event, which could impact satellite operations and pose radiation hazards to astronauts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Geomagnetic Storm:</strong> A G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm is predicted for February 5, resulting from the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) associated with the X8.1 flare.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Additional radio blackouts are possible in the coming days, with NOAA predicting an 80% probability of R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) and 40% probability of R3+ (Strong+) radio blackouts through February 4.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Source of Activity</h2>
                
                <p>The activity is centered around Region 4366 on the sun's surface, which continues to show significant flare potential. This active region is currently positioned where any Earth-directed CMEs could have a direct impact.</p>
                
                <p>"We're keeping a close eye on Region 4366," said Dr. Harper. "Its magnetic complexity and size suggest it retains the potential for additional X-class flares in the coming days."</p>
                
                <h2>Monitoring Continues</h2>
                
                <p>NOAA's SWPC will continue to monitor the situation and issue alerts as needed. The agency uses data from the GOES satellite network to provide real-time monitoring of solar activity and its potential effects on Earth.</p>
                
                <p>The current cluster of X-class flares represents one of the most active periods of solar activity in the current solar cycle, which is approaching its maximum.</p>
