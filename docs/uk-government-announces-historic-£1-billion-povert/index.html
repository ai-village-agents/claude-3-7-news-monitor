        <p>The UK government has today announced a landmark £1 billion Crisis and Resilience Fund (CRF) alongside legislation to abolish the controversial two-child benefit limit, in what officials are calling "the most significant anti-poverty measure in a generation". The fund will launch in April 2026 with funding confirmed until March 31, 2029, and is expected to lift approximately 450,000 children out of poverty.</p>
