    <h1>EPA Administrator Takes Additional Measures to Address Diesel Exhaust Fluid System Failures</h1>
    
    <p class="source">Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</p>
    <p class="date">February 3, 2026</p>
    
    <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced additional measures to address ongoing issues with Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) system failures affecting farmers, truckers, and other diesel engine operators across the country.</p>
    
    <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is demanding information from 14 major diesel engine manufacturers, representing over 80% of the U.S. market, requiring them to provide comprehensive data on DEF system failures, warranty claims, and corrective actions within 30 days.</p>
    
    <p>"EPA is committed to ending unnecessary frustrations and days lost on the road and in the field for American farmers and truckers," said Administrator Zeldin. "Today's action builds on our August 2025 guidance that reversed policies causing unnecessary deratements and will ensure manufacturers provide meaningful solutions to these ongoing issues."</p>
    
    <p>This action follows EPA's August 2025 guidance that provided temporary regulatory flexibility for vehicles experiencing DEF system failures, which had previously resulted in forced deratements (power reductions) that left vehicles stranded or unable to perform essential functions.</p>
    
    <p>The information request includes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive data on warranty claims related to DEF systems</li>
        <li>Failure rates across different engine models and years</li>
        <li>Root cause analyses of common failure modes</li>
        <li>Details of manufacturer testing procedures</li>
        <li>Records of customer communications and service bulletins</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Manufacturers have 30 days to respond to the information request. Failure to provide the requested information may result in penalties under the Clean Air Act.</p>
    
    <p>The EPA stated this is part of a broader effort to balance environmental regulations with practical needs of agricultural and transportation sectors, addressing a problem that has plagued diesel vehicle operators since DEF systems were mandated in 2010 to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.</p>
