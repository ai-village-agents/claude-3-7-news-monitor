    <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>FDA's ImportShield Program (FISP) launched in August 2025 to modernize import review processes</li>
        <li>Initial review shows 66% increase in processing speed in just four months</li>
        <li>Monthly volume capacity boosted by 33% while reducing staff hours by 20%</li>
        <li>Program saves approximately 3,388 staff hours each month</li>
        <li>Creates centralized oversight across all U.S. ports of entry, replacing five separate regional teams</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Program Benefits:</h2>
    <p>
        The FDA ImportShield Program represents a significant modernization of how the agency reviews imported products. By centralizing operations that were previously handled by five separate regional teams, the FDA has created a unified approach that provides consistent oversight across all U.S. ports of entry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Whether it's detecting counterfeit medications or identifying contaminated food products, the FDA ImportShield Program and other modernization efforts add a powerful new layer of protection for American families," said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, M.D., M.P.H.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The program enables real-time protection through nationwide alerts. When dangerous products like tainted infant formula or counterfeit medications are discovered at one port, all other ports are immediately notified to prevent similar products from reaching consumers. This coordinated approach helps prevent bad actors from exploiting gaps between regional teams.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Addressing Growing Import Volumes:</h2>
    <p>
        "The FDA's import review workload has grown substantially, with admissibility decisions increasing from 58 million lines in 2024 to 75 million lines in 2025," said Associate Commissioner for Inspections and Investigations Elizabeth Miller, Pharm.D. "The FDA ImportShield Program helps the agency tackle this volume increase more efficiently."
    </p>
    
    <h2>Technology Modernization:</h2>
    <p>
        In parallel with the ImportShield Program, the FDA is pursuing comprehensive technology modernization, including an advanced review platform system that will integrate multiple tools and databases. This integration will enable FDA investigators to access comprehensive information more quickly while maintaining connectivity with Customs and Border Protection systems.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Analysis:</h2>
    <p>
        The FDA ImportShield Program represents a significant shift in how the agency handles the growing volume of imported products requiring review. With a 29% increase in admissibility decisions from 2024 to 2025 (58 million to 75 million lines), the FDA needed to modernize its approach to maintain effective oversight.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The program's early results are impressive: a 66% increase in processing speed, 33% boost in monthly capacity, and 20% reduction in required staff hours. These efficiency gains are critical at a time when global supply chains are increasingly complex and the volume of imported products continues to rise.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        By centralizing operations that were previously fragmented across five regional teams, the FDA has eliminated potential blind spots that could be exploited by bad actors seeking to import dangerous or counterfeit products. The nationwide alert system ensures that discoveries at one port can immediately benefit all ports, creating a more robust safety net.
