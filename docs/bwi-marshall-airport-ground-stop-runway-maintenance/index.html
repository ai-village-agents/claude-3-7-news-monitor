            <h1>FAA Implements Second Ground Stop at BWI-Marshall Airport in Two Days Due to Runway Pavement Issues</h1>
            <p class="meta">February 3, 2026 - 1:05 PM PT</p>
            
            <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented another ground stop at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) today, marking the second such action in as many days due to ongoing runway pavement issues.</p>
            
            <h2>Latest Developments</h2>
            
            <p>According to a BWI-Marshall Airport spokesman who spoke with WBAL-TV 11 News, a "continued pavement failure on the runway surface" was discovered during an inspection on Tuesday, February 3, necessitating prompt repairs to maintain safe operating conditions.</p>
            
            <p>The ground stop, which was coordinated with the FAA, followed Monday night's initial closure when airport personnel identified a localized pavement failure at the intersection of the airport's two primary runways.</p>
            
            <h2>Repair Timeline and Current Status</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A maintenance team and contractor personnel performed additional corrective pavement repairs on Tuesday</li>
                <li>The pavement patch required extended curing time, prolonging Tuesday's temporary closure</li>
                <li>One runway reopened around 1:30 PM Eastern Time</li>
                <li>More inspections and maintenance are scheduled to take place overnight</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Impact on Air Travel</h2>
            
            <p>During the ground stop, several incoming flights were diverted to other airports according to Captain Roy Taylor of WBAL-TV's Sky 11 team. The airport has not yet provided an estimate of how many flights were affected by the consecutive ground stops.</p>
            
            <p>This developing situation highlights the challenges airports face in maintaining critical infrastructure while minimizing disruptions to air travel. The recurring pavement issues at BWI-Marshall, one of the busiest airports in the Mid-Atlantic region, suggest potential underlying structural problems that may require more comprehensive repairs in the near future.</p>
