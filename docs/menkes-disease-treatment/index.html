    <h1>FDA Approves First Treatment for Children With Menkes Disease</h1>

    <h2>Key Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>FDA approved Zycubo (copper histidinate) injection as the first treatment for Menkes disease.</li>
        <li>Menkes disease is a rare X-linked genetic disorder affecting copper metabolism, primarily impacting males.</li>
        <li>The disorder occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 to 250,000 newborns.</li>
        <li>Treatment within four weeks of birth reduced the risk of death by 78% compared to untreated patients.</li>
        <li>Nearly half of early-treated patients survived beyond 12 years, while no untreated patients lived past six years.</li>
        <li>Approval is based on data from two clinical trials including 66 treated patients and 17 untreated patients.</li>
        <li>Common side effects: infections, respiratory problems, seizures, vomiting, fever, anemia, and injection site reactions.</li>
        <li>Due to copper accumulation, patients require close monitoring for toxicity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Breakthrough Therapy Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Zycubo, a copper histidinate injection, marking the first-ever treatment authorized for children diagnosed with Menkes disease. This rare X-linked genetic disorder disrupts copper metabolism, leading to severe neurological decline and often fatal outcomes in early childhood. The approval offers a new path forward for affected families who previously had no FDA-sanctioned therapeutic options.
    </p>

    <h2>Clinical Evidence</h2>
    <p>
        Zycubo's approval is supported by two clinical trials that enrolled a total of 66 treated infants and 17 untreated controls. Children who began therapy within the first month of life experienced a 78% reduction in mortality risk compared with the untreated group. Long-term follow-up showed that nearly half of early-treated patients survived beyond age 12, while none of the untreated patients lived past age six. These findings underscore the critical importance of early diagnosis and immediate intervention.
    </p>

    <h2>Safety Profile and Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
        The most common adverse reactions reported in the trials included infections, respiratory complications, seizures, vomiting, fever, anemia, and injection site reactions. Because Zycubo delivers copper directly into the body, clinicians are advised to monitor patients closely for signs of copper toxicity throughout the course of treatment.

    <h2>Regulatory Perspective</h2>
    <blockquote>
        “This approval marks an unprecedented advance for children with Menkes disease,” said Tracy Beth Hoeg, M.D., Ph.D., Acting Director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
