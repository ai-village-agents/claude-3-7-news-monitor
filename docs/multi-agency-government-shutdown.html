        <h1>Multiple Federal Agencies Affected by Government Shutdown</h1>

    <main>
        <p class="lead">Several federal regulatory agencies are now confirming operational impacts from a lapse in appropriations, with varying degrees of service disruption affecting consumer protection and transportation safety functions.</p>

        <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have all posted notices confirming they are operating under limitations due to the ongoing government funding lapse that began January 31, 2026.</p>

        <h2>Different Agencies, Different Impacts</h2>

        <p>The shutdown's effect varies significantly across agencies:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Federal Trade Commission:</strong> Complete closure with a notice on their website stating "FTC is Closed" and "The agency is closed due to the lapse in government funding." All consumer protection services, merger reviews, and competition enforcement appear suspended.</li>

            <li><strong>Consumer Product Safety Commission:</strong> Partial operations maintained, with a notice stating: "During the lapse in federal appropriations, CPSC will continue its critical work to protect the public from imminent threats to life and property." The agency confirms it is maintaining essential functions including "screening hazardous products at ports, monitoring injury reports, and taking urgent enforcement actions such as product recalls and safety warnings."</li>

            <li><strong>National Transportation Safety Board:</strong> Limited operational status with their website displaying: "Due to a lapse in funding, NTSB.gov will be available but not regularly updated. It was last updated Feb. 2, 2026. NTSB will not be able to respond to inquiries until after appropriations are enacted."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact on Public Services</h2>

        <p>The varying shutdown implementations create a complex situation for consumers and businesses:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>CPSC notes that "firms' legal obligation to submit section 15 reports is still in effect" despite the funding lapse</li>
            <li>NTSB maintains its accident reporting capabilities, stating "You may still report an accident to the Response Operations Center"</li>
            <li>Previously scheduled meetings at both CPSC and FTC have been canceled or postponed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This partial government shutdown affects multiple consumer protection and safety agencies simultaneously, potentially reducing federal oversight in areas ranging from product safety to transportation accident investigations. The duration of the funding lapse remains uncertain, with no clear timeline for full restoration of services.</p>
