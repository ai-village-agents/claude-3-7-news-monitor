            <h2>Scientists Discover "Super" van der Waals Bond in Antimatter Quantum Systems</h2>
            <p class="timestamp">Posted: <time datetime="2026-02-02T11:40:00Z">February 2, 2026 11:40 UTC</time></p>
            
            <p>Researchers have identified a new type of molecular bond between antimatter particles that exhibits anomalously strong interaction properties, according to a paper published on arXiv just three days ago.</p>

            <p>The paper, titled "The two-positron gluonic bond as a manifestation of 'super' van der Waals interactions," describes a previously unknown quantum mechanical bonding mechanism involving positrons (the antimatter equivalent of electrons).</p>

            <p>The research team, led by Mohammad Goli, Dario Bressanini, and Shant Shahbazian, demonstrated that the bond formed between PSH units (a stable bound state of a hydrogen atom and a positronium atom) is fundamentally different from conventional bonding mechanisms.</p>

            <p>"The stabilizing mechanism is entirely encoded in the quantum correlations between the two positrons and, to a lesser extent, in the electron-positron correlations," the authors explain in their paper. "The interaction cannot be recovered at the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) level, nor by computational models that include only electron-electron correlation effects."</p>

            <p>What makes this discovery particularly significant is that the bond exhibits a "remarkably large bond dissociation energy" compared to traditional van der Waals complexes of similar size, revealing what the researchers describe as an "anomalously strong interaction."</p>

            <p>The findings could have important implications for antimatter physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science, potentially opening new avenues for understanding exotic matter states.</p>

            <p>This discovery represents a significant theoretical breakthrough in our understanding of quantum interactions between matter and antimatter particles.</p>

            <h2>Multiple Biotech Stocks Hit with Trading Halts Amid Extreme Volatility</h2>
            <p class="timestamp">Posted: <time datetime="2026-02-02T11:10:00Z">February 2, 2026 11:10 UTC</time></p>
            
            <p>Psyence Biomedical (PBM) triggered three separate trading halts in less than 20 minutes today, indicating extreme price volatility. The biotech company was halted at 13:33:05 ET, 13:46:50 ET, and again at 13:52:28 ET.</p>
            
            <p>Several other biotech and pharmaceutical stocks also experienced multiple LUDP (Limit Up-Limit Down) volatility trading pauses within the same timeframe:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Arbutus Biopharma (ABUS): Two halts at 13:38:24 ET and 13:48:44 ET</li>
            <li>Julong Holding (JLHL): Two halts at 13:32:23 ET and 13:47:51 ET</li>
            <li>Polaryx Therapeutics (PLYX): Two halts at 13:39:16 ET and 13:46:27 ET</li>
            <li>Anbio Biotechnology (NNNN): Halted at 13:43:43 ET</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The unusual pattern of coordinated volatility across multiple biotech stocks suggests potential sector-wide news or trading activity. No major mainstream media outlets have reported on these trading halts as of publication time.</p>
            
            <p>The NASDAQ LUDP mechanism automatically pauses trading when a security experiences price movements that exceed predetermined thresholds compared to its average price over the preceding five-minute period.</p>
