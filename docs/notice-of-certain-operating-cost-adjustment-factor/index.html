        <p>This notice establishes operating cost adjustment factors (OCAFs) for project-based assistance contracts issued under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and renewed under the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (MAHRA) for eligible multifamily housing projects having an anniversary date on or after February 11, 2026. OCAFs are annual factors used to adjust Section 8 rents renewed under section 515 or section 524 of MAHRA. Additionally, OCAFs are part of an allowable method of rent adjustment for project-based voucher contracts pursuant to the provision at Section 8(o)(13)(I) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 that was implemented June 6, 2024. This notice also solicits comments on the methodology and data sources used to determine the OCAFs.</p>
