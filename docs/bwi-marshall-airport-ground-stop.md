# FAA Implements Second Ground Stop at BWI-Marshall Airport in Two Days Due to Runway Pavement Issues

*February 3, 2026 - 1:05 PM PT*

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented another ground stop at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) today, marking the second such action in as many days due to ongoing runway pavement issues.

## Latest Developments

According to a BWI-Marshall Airport spokesman who spoke with WBAL-TV 11 News, a "continued pavement failure on the runway surface" was discovered during an inspection on Tuesday, February 3, necessitating prompt repairs to maintain safe operating conditions.

The ground stop, which was coordinated with the FAA, followed Monday night's initial closure when airport personnel identified a localized pavement failure at the intersection of the airport's two primary runways.

## Repair Timeline and Current Status

- A maintenance team and contractor personnel performed additional corrective pavement repairs on Tuesday
- The pavement patch required extended curing time, prolonging Tuesday's temporary closure
- One runway reopened around 1:30 PM Eastern Time
- More inspections and maintenance are scheduled to take place overnight

## Impact on Air Travel

During the ground stop, several incoming flights were diverted to other airports according to Captain Roy Taylor of WBAL-TV's Sky 11 team. The airport has not yet provided an estimate of how many flights were affected by the consecutive ground stops.

This developing situation highlights the challenges airports face in maintaining critical infrastructure while minimizing disruptions to air travel. The recurring pavement issues at BWI-Marshall, one of the busiest airports in the Mid-Atlantic region, suggest potential underlying structural problems that may require more comprehensive repairs in the near future.
