        <li>FDA issues Request for Information (RFI) regarding labeling and preventing cross-contact of gluten in packaged food</li>
        <li>First step in broader initiative to improve transparency in food ingredient disclosures for health-related conditions</li>

    <h2>The Initiative:</h2>
    <p>
        The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a Request for Information regarding labeling and prevention of cross-contact of gluten in packaged foods. This action marks the first step in a broader initiative to improve transparency in food ingredient disclosures that impact health conditions, with a specific focus on gluten for those with celiac disease and other established food allergens.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        "Today, we advance the MAHA Strategy's directive by demanding radical transparency in packaged food ingredients that affect health conditions and diet-related allergies," Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. said. "Americans deserve clear, reliable information about what's in their food and how it's made. Public input calling for honest labeling will protect consumers, prevent harm, and Make America Healthy Again."
    </p>
    
    <h2>Focus on "Ingredients of Interest":</h2>
    <p>
        The agency is specifically seeking information on adverse reactions due to "ingredients of interest," which include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-wheat gluten containing grains (GCGs), specifically rye and barley</li>
        <li>Oats that may be cross-contaminated with gluten containing grains</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        "People with celiac disease or gluten sensitives have had to tiptoe around food, and are often forced to guess about their food options," said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, M.D., M.P.H. "We encourage all stakeholders to share their experiences and data to help us develop policies that will better protect Americans and support healthy food choices."
    </p>
    
    <h2>Addressing Data Gaps:</h2>
    <p>
        The FDA's review of available data and reports indicates several serious gaps in information that limit the agency's ability to fully evaluate the public health importance of these ingredients. These gaps include limited U.S. data on adverse reactions to the "ingredients of interest."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The agency is seeking detailed information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevalence of products where rye or barley are not currently disclosed on labels</li>
        <li>Information on the severity and potency of immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergies to rye and barley</li>
        <li>Concerns around the gluten content of oats due to cross-contact with gluten-containing grains</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Analysis:</h2>
    <p>
        This FDA initiative represents a significant potential shift in food labeling requirements, particularly for the estimated 2 million Americans with celiac disease and many others with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Current gluten labeling regulations in the U.S. have focused primarily on wheat as a major allergen, leaving gaps in the disclosure of other gluten sources such as rye and barley.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The FDA's action aligns with Secretary Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" initiative, which has emphasized greater transparency in food ingredients and production methods. This marks one of the first major food policy directives under the new administration's health strategy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If the RFI leads to new labeling requirements, food manufacturers could face additional testing and disclosure obligations, particularly regarding cross-contamination issues that have been a persistent challenge for gluten-sensitive consumers.
