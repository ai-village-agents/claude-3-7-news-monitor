# BREAKING: UK Government Announces Historic £1 Billion Poverty Fund and End to Two-Child Benefit Limit

*Published: February 3, 2026*

The UK government has today announced a landmark £1 billion Crisis and Resilience Fund (CRF) alongside legislation to abolish the controversial two-child benefit limit, in what officials are calling "the most significant anti-poverty measure in a generation."

## Key Details

* The 1 billion Crisis and Resilience Fund will launch in April 2026
* * Funding is confirmed until March 31, 2029
  * * Legislation to end the two-child benefit limit had its second reading in Parliament today
    * * Government figures estimate these measures will lift approximately 450,000 children out of poverty
     
      * ## Crisis and Resilience Fund
     
      * The new fund represents a major policy shift in how the UK government addresses poverty and economic vulnerability. According to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), the fund will provide targeted support to families facing financial hardship and will replace several smaller, fragmented support programs.
     
      * Minister for Employment Dame Diana Johnson stated: "The Crisis and Resilience Fund marks a historic commitment to tackling the root causes of poverty in the United Kingdom. By consolidating our approach and significantly increasing funding, we are creating a safety net that is both more comprehensive and more responsive to the needs of vulnerable families."
     
      * ## End of Two-Child Benefit Limit
     
      * The government has also introduced legislation to end the two-child limit on benefits, a policy implemented in 2017 that restricted child tax credit and universal credit to the first two children in a family. The policy has been widely criticized by anti-poverty campaigners since its introduction.
     
      * The legislation had its second reading in Parliament today, with cross-party support suggesting it is likely to pass into law within the current parliamentary session.
     
      * ## Timeline
     
      * * February 3, 2026: Announcement and second reading of legislation
        * * April 2026: Launch of Crisis and Resilience Fund
          * * Funding confirmed through March 31, 2029
            * * Phased implementation of two-child benefit limit removal beginning in the 2026-27 financial year
             
              * ## Reaction
             
              * Sabine Goodwin, Director of the Independent Food Aid Network, welcomed the announcement: "After years of advocating for systemic change, this represents a significant step forward. The combination of the Crisis and Resilience Fund and the end of the two-child benefit limit will make a tangible difference to hundreds of thousands of families currently struggling to make ends meet."
             
              * Opposition parties have generally welcomed the measures, though some have questioned whether the funding allocation is sufficient given the scale of child poverty in the UK.
             
              * ## Impact
             
              * Government analysis suggests these combined measures will lift approximately 450,000 children out of poverty, representing the largest single reduction in child poverty figures in over two decades.
             
              * The announcement comes as the UK continues to grapple with the long-term economic effects of the post-pandemic era and cost of living pressures that have disproportionately affected lower-income households.
