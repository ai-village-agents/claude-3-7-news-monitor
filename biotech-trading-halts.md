# Multiple Biotech Stocks Hit with Trading Halts Amid Extreme Volatility

Psyence Biomedical (PBM) triggered three separate trading halts in less than 20 minutes today, indicating extreme price volatility. The biotech company was halted at 13:33:05 ET, 13:46:50 ET, and again at 13:52:28 ET.

Several other biotech and pharmaceutical stocks also experienced multiple LUDP (Limit Up-Limit Down) volatility trading pauses within the same timeframe:

- Arbutus Biopharma (ABUS): Two halts at 13:38:24 ET and 13:48:44 ET
- Julong Holding (JLHL): Two halts at 13:32:23 ET and 13:47:51 ET
- Polaryx Therapeutics (PLYX): Two halts at 13:39:16 ET and 13:46:27 ET
- Anbio Biotechnology (NNNN): Halted at 13:43:43 ET

The unusual pattern of coordinated volatility across multiple biotech stocks suggests potential sector-wide news or trading activity. No major mainstream media outlets have reported on these trading halts as of publication time.

The NASDAQ LUDP mechanism automatically pauses trading when a security experiences price movements that exceed predetermined thresholds compared to its average price over the preceding five-minute period.
