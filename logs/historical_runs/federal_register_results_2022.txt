The NCUA Board (Board) is seeking comment on a proposed rule that would amend the NCUA's rules regarding the purchase of loan participations and the purchase, sale, and pledge of eligible obligations and other loans (including notes of liquidating credit unions). The proposed rule is intended to clarify the NCUA's current regulations and provide additional flexibility for federally insured credit unions (FICUs) to make use of advanced technologies and opportunities offered by the financial technology (fintech) sector. The proposal would also make conforming amendments to the NCUA's rule regarding loans to members and lines of credit to members by adding new provisions about indirect lending arrangements and indirect leasing arrangements. Finally, the proposal would make other conforming changes and technical amendments in other sections of the NCUA's regulations. The Board does not view these conforming and technical changes as substantive.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-09- 15, which applied to all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000 and FALCON 2000EX airplanes. AD 2022-09-15 required relocating affected servo- valves and revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to provide temporary information necessary to operate airplanes fitted with at least one affected brake servo-valve. AD 2022-09-15 also limited or prohibited the installation of affected brake servo-valves. This AD was prompted by a determination that replacing certain brake servo-valves is necessary to address the unsafe condition. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-09-15, including the parts installation limitation or prohibition, and also requires replacing an affected part with a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference (IBR). The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) is classifying the pediatric Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis aid into class II (special controls). The special controls that apply to the device type are identified in this order and will be part of the codified language for the pediatric Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis aid's classification. We are taking this action because we have determined that classifying the device into class II (special controls) will provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. We believe this action will also enhance patients' access to beneficial innovative devices.

A PSO can be "delisted" by the Secretary if it is found to no longer meet the requirements of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act) and Patient Safety Rule, when a PSO chooses to voluntarily relinquish its status as a PSO for any reason, or when a PSO's listing expires. AHRQ accepted a notification of proposed voluntary relinquishment from the Zephcare PSO, PSO number P0200, of its status as a PSO, and has delisted the PSO accordingly.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is amending the official commentary that interprets the requirements of the Bureau's Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure) to reflect the asset- size exemption threshold for banks, savings associations, and credit unions based on the annual percentage change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI- W). Based on the 8.6 percent increase in the average of the CPI-W for the 12-month period ending in November 2022, the exemption threshold is adjusted to $54 million from $50 million. Therefore, banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets of $54 million or less as of December 31, 2022, are exempt from collecting data in 2023.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/12/30/2022-28439/truth-in-lending-act-regulation-z-adjustment-to-asset-size-exemption-threshold
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) is amending the official commentary to its Regulation Z in order to make annual adjustments to the asset-size thresholds exempting certain creditors from the requirement to establish an escrow account for a higher-priced mortgage loan (HPML). These changes reflect updates to the exemption from the escrow requirement in the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) for creditors that, together with their affiliates that regularly extended covered transactions secured by first liens, had total assets of less than $2 billion (adjusted annually for inflation). They also reflect updates to the exemption the Bureau added, by implementing section 108 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), for certain insured depository institutions and insured credit unions with assets of $10 billion or less (adjusted annually for inflation). These amendments are based on the annual percentage change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Based on the 8.6 percent increase in the average of the CPI-W for the 12-month period ending in November 2022, the exemption threshold for creditors and their affiliates that regularly extended covered transactions secured by first liens is adjusted to $2.537 billion from $2.336 billion and the exemption threshold for certain insured depository institutions and insured credit unions with assets of $10 billion or less is adjusted to $11.374 billion from $10.473 billion.

On the basis of such determination, the Secretary of HHS declared, on September 7, 2022, that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of infection with the monkeypox virus, including in vitro diagnostics that detect and/or diagnose infection with non-variola Orthopoxvirus, pursuant to the FD&C Act, subject to terms of any authorization issued under that section. The Authorization, which includes an explanation of the reasons for issuance, is reprinted in this document.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500- 1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by reports of flight control (horizontal stabilizer, rudder, and elevator) decals degrading and peeling (damage), reports of operators painting over these decals, and reports that procedures to replace these decals were inaccurate, potentially causing incorrect positioning of replacement decals. This AD requires inspecting the left and right horizontal stabilizer decals for visibility and damage; and for certain airplanes, inspecting the rudder and left and right elevator decals for visibility and damage; and doing applicable corrective actions; as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "E19 A Selective Approach to Safety Data Collection in Specific Late-Stage Pre-approval or Post-Approval Clinical Trials." The final guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The guidance revises the draft guidance for industry entitled "E19 Optimisation of Safety Data Collection" issued in June 2019. The final guidance provides recommendations regarding appropriate use of a selective approach to safety data collection in some late-stage pre- or post-marketing studies of drugs where the safety profile, with respect to commonly occurring adverse events, is well understood and documented. The final guidance is intended to advance important clinical research questions through the conduct of clinical investigations that collect relevant patient data, which will enable an adequate benefit-risk assessment of the drug for its intended use, while reducing the burden to patients from unnecessary tests that may yield limited additional information.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is considering approval of three amendment requests. The amendment requests are for Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Byron Station, Unit 2; and Beaver Valley Power Station, Units 1 and 2. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that they involve no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because each amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.

The Coast Guard proposes to further delay the effective date for certain facilities affected by the final rule entitled "Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)--Reader Requirements," published in the Federal Register on August 23, 2016. The current effective date for the final rule is May 8, 2023. The Coast Guard proposes delaying the effective date for: facilities that handle certain dangerous cargoes in bulk, but do not transfer those cargoes to or from a vessel; facilities that handle certain dangerous cargoes in bulk, and do transfer those cargoes to or from a vessel; and facilities that receive vessels carrying certain dangerous cargoes in bulk, but do not, during that vessel-to-facility interface, transfer those bulk cargoes to or from those vessels. Specifically, we propose to delay the effective date for these facilities for 3 years from the original delay expiration date of May 8, 2023 to May 8, 2026, but invite comments as well on possibly extending the delay through as late as May 8, 2029. This delay will give the Coast Guard time to further analyze the potential effectiveness of the reader requirement in general as well as at these facilities.

The FHWA, on behalf of Caltrans, is issuing this notice to announce Caltrans' adoption of the Maritime Administration's (MARAD) Combined Final Environmental Impact Statement/Record of Decision and Final Section 4(f) Evaluation, (FEIS/ROD) for the Port of Long Beach (POLB or Port) Pier B On-Dock Rail Support Facility Project (Project). The Final EIS and ROD for the Pier B On-Dock Rail Support Facility Project were approved by MARAD on April 7, 2022. MARAD's Notice of Availability for the Final EIS and ROD was published in the Federal Register on April 15, 2022. Under 49 U.S.C. 304a(b), MARAD issued a single Final EIS and ROD (USEPA, 2022). Therefore, the 30-day wait/ review period under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) did not apply to the action (Federal Register, 2022). Pursuant to 40 CFR 1506.3(b)(2), Caltrans was a cooperating agency on this project. Therefore, recirculation of the document is not necessary under Section 1506.3(c) of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319 series airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, -233, -251N, - 252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, and -273N airplanes; and Model A321 series airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that certain overheat detection system (OHDS) sensing elements installed at certain positions might not properly detect thermal bleed leak events due to a quality escape during the manufacturing process. This proposed AD would require a one-time detailed inspection of each affected part installed at an affected position and, depending on the findings, replacement; and would prohibit the installation of affected parts at affected positions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-08-19, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 787-8, -9, and -10 airplanes. AD 2021-08-19 requires repetitive general visual inspections for disengaged or damaged decompression panels of the bilge barriers located in the forward and aft cargo compartments, reinstallation of disengaged but undamaged panels, and replacement of damaged panels. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-08-19, new procedures for changing or replacing the bilge barrier assembly in the forward cargo compartment have been developed. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2021-08-19 and require changing or replacing the bilge barrier assembly in the forward and aft cargo compartments, which would terminate the repetitive inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that, due to a lack of flightcrew awareness, smoke hoods with a certain part number installed throughout the airplane could be mistaken for protective breathing equipment (PBE). This proposed AD would require an inspection or records review to determine if any smoke hood with a certain part number is installed in any location on the airplane and, depending on the results, removing the smoke hood and associated placards and installing new placards. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

PHMSA is publishing this notice to provide awareness and solicit comments on an application for a special permit currently under review by PHMSA in consultation with the Federal Railroad Administration. An applicant is seeking a special permit to authorize the transportation in commerce of cryogenic ethane in DOT-113C120W9 and DOT-113C120W tank cars via rail freight. PHMSA notes that the subject matter of the special permit--i.e., transportation of cryogenic flammable liquids in rail tank cars--raises issues similar to the transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) by rail, a matter for which multiple rulemakings are currently pending at the agency. Therefore, PHMSA is providing an opportunity for public comment on the application.

NMFS proposes to implement annual catch limits (ACL) and accountability measures (AM) for main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) deepwater shrimp and precious coral for each fishing year in the time period between 2022 and 2025. As a post-season AM, if NMFS determines that the most recent three-year average total catch exceeded an ACL in a fishing year, we would reduce the ACL for the following fishing year by the amount of the overage. This proposed rule supports the long-term sustainability of MHI deepwater shrimp and precious coral.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Helicopters Model AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, and AS355N helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a partially broken tail rotor drive fan support (fan support) and a completely broken fan support. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting certain part-numbered fan supports (affected parts), and depending on the results, removing an affected part from service and replacing it with a serviceable part, which constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This proposed AD would also require replacing affected parts with serviceable parts unless already accomplished and prohibit installing an affected part on any helicopter, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to partially approve and partially disapprove the Arizona state implementation plan (SIP) as meeting the requirements of sections 110(a)(1) and 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards"). Section 110(a)(1) requires that each state adopt and submit a SIP for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of each NAAQS promulgated by the EPA, and that the EPA act on such SIPs. We refer to such SIPs as "infrastructure" SIPs because they are intended to address basic structural SIP requirements for new or revised NAAQS including, but not limited to, legal authority, regulatory structure, resources, permit programs, monitoring, and modeling necessary to assure attainment and maintenance of the standards. In addition to our proposed partial approval and partial disapproval of Arizona's infrastructure SIP, the EPA is proposing to approve rules in the Arizona Revised Statutes and Pima County Code related to public availability of emissions reports into the Arizona SIP. Lastly, the EPA is proposing to reclassify regions in Arizona with respect to episode plans for ozone under 40 CFR 51.150.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to add per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) subject to reporting under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA) pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA) to the list of Lower Thresholds for Chemicals of Special Concern (chemicals of special concern). These PFAS already have a lower reporting threshold of 100 pounds. The addition of these PFAS to the list of chemicals of special concern will cause such PFAS to be subject to the same reporting requirements as other chemicals of special concern (i.e., it would eliminate the use of the de minimis exemption and the option to use Form A and would limit the use of range reporting for PFAS). Removing the availability of these burden-reduction reporting options will result in a more complete picture of the releases and waste management quantities for these PFAS. In addition, EPA is proposing to remove the availability of the de minimis exemption for purposes of the Supplier Notification Requirements for all chemicals on the list of chemicals of special concern. This change will help ensure that purchasers of mixtures and trade name products containing such chemicals are informed of their presence in mixtures and products they purchase.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a revised draft guidance for industry entitled "ANDAs: Pre-Submission Facility Correspondence Related to Prioritized Generic Drug Submissions." For purposes of implementing the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 (GDUFA III), the Pre-Submission Facility Correspondence (PFC) process was revised as part of the performance goals and program enhancements agreed to by FDA and industry, as described in the GDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements, Fiscal Years 2023 through 2027 (GDUFA III commitment letter). FDA assesses facility information submitted in a PFC to inform the Agency's decision regarding the need for facility inspections that support assessment of the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). A complete and accurate PFC allows the Agency to begin the facility assessment process in advance of the planned ANDA submission for priority ANDAs, allowing the Agency more time to make preapproval inspection decisions. A PFC meeting the conditions outlined in the revised draft guidance will qualify the ANDA for a shorter, 8- month priority review goal. This revised draft guidance describes the content, timing, and assessment of a complete and accurate PFC for purposes of GDUFA III. Additionally, this revised draft guidance provides information on the Agency's rationale for and current approach to assessing a PFC and replaces the previous draft guidance for industry, "ANDAs: Pre-Submission of Facility Information Related to Prioritized Generic Drug Applications (Pre-Submission Facility Correspondence)," issued in November 2017.

Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/12/02/2022-26228/npdes-small-ms4-urbanized-area-clarification
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to clarify its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Phase II regulations due to recent changes made by the Census Bureau. The changes to EPA's regulations are limited to clarifying that the designation criteria for small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), which have been used since the promulgation of the regulations in 1999, will remain the same. These clarifications are necessary due to the Census Bureau's recent decision to discontinue its practice of publishing the location of "urbanized areas" along with the 2020 Census and future censuses. The clarification in this direct final rule replaces the term "urbanized area" in the Phase II regulations with the phrase "urban areas with a population of at least 50,000," which is the Census Bureau's longstanding definition of the term urbanized areas. This change will allow NPDES permitting authorities to use 2020 Census and future Census data in a manner that is consistent with existing longstanding regulatory practice. Because this clarification maintains the current scope of which entities are regulated as small MS4s, it is not expected to generate opposition, and EPA is publishing the clarification in the Federal Register as a direct final rule. As is EPA's practice for direct final rules, EPA is also publishing a parallel proposed rulemaking with the same changes included in this direct final rule if the Agency receives adverse comments.

In the final rule, the amendments to V-436 addressed in the preamble were incomplete and did not address all of the airway segment amendments being made.

The correct characterization of the AILEE, AK, route point is as a Fix. This action corrects the oversight of not including all of the V-436 amendments addressed in the preamble to match the V-436 description in the regulatory text and changes all references of the AILEE, AK, WP to the AILEE, AK, Fix to match the FAA's National Airspace System Resource (NASR) database information.

EPA is issuing significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) and a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice (MCAN). The SNURs require persons who intend to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) or process any of these chemical substances for an activity that is designated as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the use, under the conditions of use for that chemical substance, within the applicable review period. Persons may not commence manufacture or processing for the significant new use until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and has taken such actions as are required by that determination.

Test participants will voluntarily provide specific global business identifiers (GBIs) for the manufacturers, sellers, and shippers of merchandise covered by specified types of entries, which are limited for purposes of this test to certain commodities and countries of origin. Test participants may also, optionally, provide specific GBIs for exporters, distributors, and packagers associated with the covered entries. The test will permit CBP and certain Partner Government Agencies (PGAs) to access the underlying data associated with the GBIs (referred to as the "GBI data"), to determine whether the submission of GBIs at the time of entry filing will enable the enhanced tracing of the supply chains of certain commodities. This notice invites importers of record and licensed customs brokers to participate in the test, provides a description of the test, sets forth the criteria for participation, and invites public comments on all aspects of the test.

EPA is proposing significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) and are also subject to Orders issued by EPA pursuant to TSCA. The SNURs would require persons who intend to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) or process any of these chemical substances for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the use, under the conditions of use for that chemical substance, within the applicable review period. Persons may not commence manufacture or processing for the significant new use until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and has taken such actions as are required in association with that determination.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-10-09, which applies to all CFM International, S.A. (CFM) CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B model turbofan engines with a certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) inner stationary seal installed. AD 2021-10-09 requires removal, inspection, and replacement of the affected HPT inner stationary seal and, depending on the findings, replacement of the rotating air HPT front seal, HPT rotor blades, and No. 3 ball bearing. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-10-09, the manufacturer notified the FAA that the service information incorrectly lists the year of certain honeycomb repairs. Additionally, the manufacturer notified the FAA that affected HPT inner stationary seals could potentially be installed on CFM CFM56-5C model turbofan engines. This proposed AD would require removal, inspection, and replacement of the affected HPT inner stationary seal and, depending on the findings, replacement of the rotating air HPT front seal, HPT rotor blades, and No. 3 ball bearing. This proposed AD would also revise the applicability to add CFM CFM56- 5C model turbofan engines. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations that would allow agencies to make term appointments in certain Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics-related ("STEM-related") occupations for up to 10 years. OPM is issuing final regulations to provide agencies with greater flexibility to staff foreseeably long-term projects of a STEM-related nature when the need for the work is not permanent. The intended effect of this change is to allow agencies the flexibility and discretion to hire individuals with knowledge, skills, and abilities tailored to a specific project that may not be required on a permanent basis or transferable to other functions of the agency. This longer-term appointment may also assist agencies in recruiting individuals with certain specialized knowledge, who may be interested in acquiring further skills and experience working on a project basis and would be less likely to pursue or accept a career position. This authority is not intended to be a substitute for regular agency hiring but is instead intended to be a supplement to existing hiring authorities that is targeted for longer-term projects that are not permanent in nature. This appointment authority provides no authority for noncompetitive conversion into a permanent competitive service position.

The Board of Governors (Board) is publishing a final rule that applies an inflation adjustment to the threshold for total consolidated assets in Regulation I. Federal Reserve Bank (Reserve Bank) stockholders that have total consolidated assets above the threshold receive a different dividend rate on their Reserve Bank stock than stockholders with total consolidated assets at or below the threshold. The Federal Reserve Act requires that the Board annually adjust the total consolidated asset threshold to reflect the change in the Gross Domestic Product Price Index, published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Based on the change in the Gross Domestic Product Price Index as of September 29, 2022, the total consolidated asset threshold will be $12,124,000,000 through December 31, 2023.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove island bedstraw (Galium buxifolium) and Santa Cruz Island dudleya (Dudleya nesiotica) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants on the basis of recovery. Both of these native plant species occur in the Channel Islands National Park off the coast of California. This proposed rule is based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial data, which indicates that the threats to island bedstraw and Santa Cruz Island dudleya have been eliminated or reduced to the point that these species have recovered and no longer meet the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We request information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule and the draft post-delisting monitoring plans for island bedstraw and Santa Cruz Island dudleya.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the Standards of Performance for secondary lead smelters per the Agency's periodic review of the new source performance standards required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). In this action, we are proposing updates to the current New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for secondary lead smelters and proposing a new NSPS subpart that applies to affected sources constructed, reconstructed, or modified after the date of this proposed rule. For the current NSPS subpart, we are proposing to revise the definitions of blast furnace, reverberatory furnace, and pot furnace to more closely align with the equipment definitions used in the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for secondary lead smelting. We are also proposing requirements for periodic performance tests for particulate matter (PM) and incorporating revised monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, including electronic reporting of performance tests, to be more consistent with the NESHAP. For the new subpart, we are proposing updated PM and opacity emissions limits for blast, reverberatory, and pot furnaces that reflect the performance achieved by the best system for emissions reductions (BSER). In the new subpart, we are proposing PM and opacity emissions limits that apply at all times, including during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM), and proposing initial and periodic PM and opacity performance testing and the same equipment definitions, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements proposed for current NSPS subpart.

The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2023. The annual indexation of these amounts is required notwithstanding the Board's action in March 2020 of setting all reserve requirement ratios to zero. The Regulation D amendments set the reserve requirement exemption amount for 2023 at $36.1 million (increased from $32.4 million in 2022) and the amount of the low reserve tranche at $691.7 million (increased from $640.6 million in 2022). The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act (the "Act"). The annual indexation of the reserve requirement exemption amount and low reserve tranche, though required by statute, will not affect depository institutions' reserve requirements, which will remain zero.

With this transfer, the adjusted General category December subquota, Reserve category quota, and Harpoon category quota will be 50.1 mt, 6 mt, and 76.4 mt respectively. This action accounts for the accrued overharvest from previous 2022 General category time period subquotas, and will further opportunities for General category fishermen to participate in the December General category fishery, based on consideration of the regulatory determination criteria regarding inseason adjustments. This action would affect Atlantic Tunas General category (commercial) permitted vessels and Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Charter/Headboat permitted vessels with a commercial sale endorsement when fishing commercially for BFT.

If adopted, this proposal would amend Publication 52, Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail (Pub 52) by requiring the use of unique service type codes and extra service codes within the electronic data submission and tracking barcodes for shipments containing HAZMAT provided to the USPS by the mailers in their Shipping Services File (SSF). This proposal would standardize the acceptance and handling of shipments containing HAZMAT by collecting electronic data to create manifests for the Postal Service's air carrier suppliers and ensuring these items are handled appropriately with regards to the category of HAMZAT contained within the package. The Postal Service also proposes to amend the Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) that would alter the refund eligibility of Priority Mail Express containing hazardous materials.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all BAE Systems (Operations) Limited Model BAe 146 series airplanes. This AD was prompted by a finding that when the autopilot is engaged, the architecture of the autopilot system does not automatically disconnect the autopilot in response to pilot application of a pitch input or when the electric pitch trim switch on either pilot control wheel is operated. This AD requires modifying the autopilot engagement circuit. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

Our review of the best available scientific and commercial information indicates that the northern long- eared bat meets the Act's definition of an endangered species. Because we are reclassifying the northern long-eared bat from a threatened to an endangered species, we are amending this species' listing on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife to reflect its endangered species status and removing its species-specific rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act.

This advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) offers an opportunity for interested individuals and organizations, particularly owner/operators of higher-risk pipeline and rail operations, to help TSA develop a comprehensive and forward-looking approach to cybersecurity requirements. TSA is also interested in input from the industry associations representing these owners/operators, third-party cybersecurity subject matter experts, and insurers and underwriters for cybersecurity risks for these transportation sectors. Although TSA will review and consider all comments submitted, we are specifically interested in responses to the questions posed in this ANPRM. Input received in response to this ANPRM will assist TSA in better understanding how the pipeline and rail sectors implement cyber risk management (CRM) in their operations and will support us in achieving objectives related to the enhancement of pipeline and rail cybersecurity.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces that the Office of Personnel Management requests approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to renew a previously approved information collection, Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) Charity Applications, OMB Control No. 3206-0269, OPM Forms 1647- A, -B, and -E. OPM uses these documents to review the eligibility of national, international, and local charitable organizations and Department of Defense morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR)/Family Support and Youth Activities/Programs (FSYA/FSYP) organizations that wish to participate in the CFC. The proposed revisions reflect improvements in the form instructions and the addition of optional fields for charities to detail the kinds of volunteer opportunities Federal employees might consider for personal service hours (outside working hours). On August 11, 2022, OPM published a 60-day notice and request for comments at 87 FR 49619. OPM received no comments. There are, therefore, no recommended revisions to this ICR. We estimate 6,000 responses to this information collection annually. Each form takes approximately two hours to complete. The annual estimated burden is 12,000 hours.

In June 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for infant walkers under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), incorporating by reference the 2007 version of ASTM's voluntary standard for infant walkers that was in effect at the time, with modifications approved by the Commission. ASTM updated its standard for infant walkers in 2012, and CPSC accepted the revised voluntary standard, without any modifications, as the mandatory standard for infant walkers. ASTM has notified CPSC of a 2022 update to the infant walkers voluntary standard. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for infant walkers to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2022 version of the voluntary standard.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Jennings Ryan Staley for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States.

The factual basis supporting Mr. Staley's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Staley was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. Mr. Staley provided notice to FDA that he acquiesced to the debarment; FDA received that notice on October 6, 2022. As such, his debarment commenced on the date FDA was notified of acquiescence.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 99-23-18, AD 2005-03-07, AD 2013-12-07, and AD 2014-04-07, which applied to certain Bell Helicopter Textron Canada (now Bell Textron Canada Limited) Model 407 helicopters. AD 99-23-18 required revising the life limits for certain parts, replacing each part that had exceeded its life limit, and revising the Airworthiness Limitation Section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual. AD 2005-03-07 required establishing a maximum accumulated Retirement Index Number (RIN) count for certain crosstube assemblies and revising the ALS of the existing maintenance manual. AD 2013-12-07 required inspecting the tailboom assembly for a crack, loose rivet, or other damage and depending on the inspection results, replacing certain parts. AD 2014-04-07 required preflight checking, repetitively inspecting for a crack in certain tailbooms, modifying and re-identifying certain tailbooms, installing an improved horizontal stabilizer assembly, and revising the ALS of the existing maintenance manual. Since the FAA issued those ADs, a report was received of a crack on the tailboom lower skin due to fatigue damage and new and more restrictive airworthiness limitations have been issued. This AD was prompted by a report of a crack on the tailboom lower skin due to fatigue damage and the issuance of new and more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD requires incorporating into existing maintenance records requirements (airworthiness limitations) as specified in the ALS service information. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Area consists of 20 counties in Georgia: Barrow, Bartow, Carroll, Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Hall, Henry, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Spalding, and Walton County. EPA is proposing to approve the LMP for the Area because the LMP provides for the maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS within the Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. The effect of this action would be to make certain commitments related to maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in the Area federally enforceable as part of the Georgia SIP.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce that we are extending the comment periods for four proposed rules under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. On September 27, 2022, we published a proposed rule to list the Florida Keys mole skink (Plestiodon egregius egregius) as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act and to designate its critical habitat. On October 14, 2022, we published proposed rules to designate critical habitat for Chamaecrista lineata var. keyensis (Big Pine partridge pea), Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. serpyllum (wedge spurge), Linum arenicola (sand flax), and Argythamnia blodgettii (Blodgett's silverbush); to designate critical habitat for Sideroxylon reclinatum ssp. austrofloridense (Everglades bully), Digitaria pauciflora (Florida pineland crabgrass), Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. pinetorum (pineland sandmat), and Dalea carthagenensis var. floridana (Florida prairie- clover); to list the Key ring-necked snake (Diadophis punctatus acricus) and the rim rock crowned snake (Tantilla oolitica) as endangered species, and to designate critical habitat for the Key ring- necked snake and the rim rock crowned snake. We are extending the comment period for each of these proposed rules to allow all interested parties additional time to comment on the proposed rules following the impacts of Hurricane Ian. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparing the final determinations.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products, including ceiling fans. The Energy Act of 2020 amended the energy conservation standards for large-diameter ceiling fans ("LDCFs"). DOE codified these efficiency requirements in a final rule published May 27, 2021. When DOE published the final rule codifying the standards for LDCFs in 2021, DOE's test procedure for LDCFs was applicable only to those ceiling fans with a diameter less than or equal to 24 feet. As a result, DOE could not implement the full scope of LDCF standards set forth in the Energy Act of 2020. In order to remedy this situation, DOE has removed this limit on ceiling fan diameter in the most recent test procedure rulemaking for ceiling fans. As such, DOE is now able to implement in this final rule the full scope of standards for LDCFs set forth in the Energy Act of 2020.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invites the general public to take this opportunity to comment on an extension, with change, of a currently approved information collection. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice seeks comments concerning changes to modernize and simplify the disaster assistance registration. The changes will reduce the burden on survivors by only requiring them to answer questions based on the type of assistance they need. This will also reduce the amount of time it takes for survivors to apply either online, or through a call center, therefore allowing call center agents to assist survivors more quickly. The notice also includes FEMA documenting all post-registration contacts, including callouts, casework, and auto-dialers performed for the purpose of determining whether disaster assistance applicants have unmet needs and may be eligible for additional assistance and/or share the results of those contacts directly with external stakeholders, such as state or local government partners, who can potentially assist those same applicants with assistance or services not provided by FEMA through specific programs directly targeted to disaster survivors.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 206A, 206A-1 (OH-58A), 206B, 206B-1, 206L, 206L-1, 206L-3, and 206L-4 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a loss of tail rotor (TR) drive due to a failure of an adhesively bonded joint between an adapter and a tube on one of the segmented TR drive shaft (TRDS) assemblies. This proposed AD would require determining if an affected TRDS is installed; repetitively inspecting the bond line for damage; repetitively performing a proof load test of the TRDS assembly; and depending on the results of the inspections or the proof load tests, removing an affected TRDS from service and replacing it with a serviceable TRDS. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing a TRDS unless it meets certain requirements, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

We are adopting a new rule and rule amendments to implement Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank Act"), which added Section 10D to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"). In accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act, the final rules direct the national securities exchanges and associations that list securities to establish listing standards that require each issuer to develop and implement a policy providing for the recovery, in the event of a required accounting restatement, of incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers where that compensation is based on the erroneously reported financial information. The listing standards must also require the disclosure of the policy. Additionally, the final rules require a listed issuer to file the policy as an exhibit to its annual report and to include other disclosures in the event a recovery analysis is triggered under the policy.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has determined that custom window coverings with accessible operating cords longer than 8 inches pose an unreasonable risk of strangulation to children 8 years old and younger. To address this risk of strangulation, the Commission is issuing a final rule under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) to require that operating cords on custom window coverings meet the same requirements as operating cords on stock window coverings, as set forth in the applicable voluntary standard. The final rule provides several methods to make window covering cords inaccessible or non-hazardous. Because this is a consumer product safety rule, operating cords on custom window coverings must be tested and certified as meeting the requirements of the final rule. Custom window coverings that meet the definition of a "children's product" require third party testing by a CPSC-accepted third party conformity assessment body. Accordingly, the final rule also amends the Commission's regulation that lists children's product rules requiring third party testing.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting rule and form amendments that require open-end management investment companies to transmit concise and visually engaging annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders that highlight key information that is particularly important for retail investors to assess and monitor their fund investments. Certain information that may be more relevant to financial professionals and investors who desire more in- depth information will no longer appear in funds' shareholder reports but will be available online, delivered free of charge upon request, and filed on a semi-annual basis on Form N-CSR. The amendments exclude open-end management investment companies from the scope of the current rule that generally permits registered investment companies to satisfy shareholder report transmission requirements by making these reports and other materials available online and providing a notice of that availability. The amendments also require that funds tag their reports to shareholders using the Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language ("Inline XBRL") structured data language to provide machine-readable data that retail investors and other market participants may use to more efficiently access and evaluate investments. Finally, the Commission is adopting amendments to the advertising rules for registered investment companies and business development companies to promote more transparent and balanced statements about investment costs.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing particulate matter (PM) emission standards and test procedures applicable to certain classes of engines used by civil subsonic jet airplanes (engines with rated output of greater than 26.7 kilonewtons (kN)) to replace the existing smoke standard for those engines. The EPA is adopting these standards under our authority in the Clean Air Act (CAA). These standards and test procedures are equivalent to the engine standards adopted by the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2017 and 2020 and will apply to both new type design aircraft engines and in-production aircraft engines. The EPA, as well as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), actively participated in the ICAO proceedings in which the ICAO requirements were developed. These standards reflect the importance of the control of PM emissions and U.S. efforts to secure the highest practicable degree of uniformity in aviation regulations and standards. Additionally, the EPA is migrating, modernizing, and streamlining the existing regulations into a new part in the Code of Federal Regulations. As part of this update, the EPA is also aligning with ICAO by applying the smoke number standards to engines less than or equal to 26.7 kilonewtons rated output used on supersonic airplanes.

In this document, the Commission proposes requirements for Emergency Alert System (EAS) Participants to report compromises of their EAS equipment, communications systems, and services to the Commission. Additionally, this document proposes requirements for EAS Participants and Commercial Mobile Service (CMS) providers that participate in Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) to annually certify to having a cybersecurity risk management plan in place and to employ sufficient security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their respective alerting systems. This document also proposes requirements for participating CMS providers to take steps to ensure that only valid alerts are displayed on consumer devices. These requirements would further protect the nation's communications systems from cybersecurity threats. With this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission seeks comment on the proposed rules and any suitable alternatives.

NMFS issues a proposed rule to implement Amendment 124 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP) and Amendment 112 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA FMP). First, this proposed rule would amend regulations for the Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) and Community Development Quota (CDQ) Programs for pot gear configurations, pot gear tending and retrieval requirements, pot limits, and associated recordkeeping and reporting requirements. These changes would increase operational efficiency and flexibility for IFQ holders and CDQ groups. Second, this proposed rule would authorize jig gear as a legal gear type for harvesting sablefish IFQ and CDQ, increasing opportunities for entry-level participants. Third, this proposed rule would temporarily remove the Adak community quota entity (CQE) residency requirement for a period of five years. These actions are intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the BSAI FMP, GOA FMP, and other applicable laws.

In addition, we are finalizing the Conditions of Participation that REHs must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This rule also finalizes changes to the Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) CoPs for the location and distance requirements, patient's rights requirements, and flexibilities for CAHs that are part of a larger health system.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), notify the public that we are requesting new information to update the Species Status Assessment (SSA) for the North American Wolverine (Gulo gulo luscus) occurring in the contiguous United States to make a final determination whether to list this species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). As a result of court action, the wolverine is now proposed for listing as a threatened species under the Act. The Service is updating the 2018 SSA and will reevaluate whether the North American wolverine occurring in the contiguous United States is a distinct population segment and, if so, whether the distinct population segment meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Act. We now request new information regarding the North American wolverine to inform our SSA update and reevaluation under the Act. As directed by the court, the Service is to make a final listing determination by the end of November 2023.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves the recordkeeping requirement for owners/operators of aircraft issued a special airworthiness certificate in the light-sport aircraft category (SLSA) to keep the current status of applicable safety directives, and transfer these records with the aircraft at the time the aircraft is sold. The information to be collected is necessary to determine and ensure the SLSA aircraft is in a condition for safe flight prior to aircraft operation. The title of this collection is being revised from Certification of Aircraft and Airmen for the Operation of Light-Sport Aircraft to Special Light-Sport Aircraft (SLSA) Safety Directive Recordkeeping, to better reflect the purpose of the information collected.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Science Advisory Board (SAB) Staff Office requests public nominations of scientific experts to form a Panel to review the draft EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Toxicological Review of Inorganic Arsenic. Based on the publicly available systematic review protocol, EPA's draft assessment includes a summary of the chemical properties and pharmacokinetics; hazard identification analysis for diseases of the circulatory system, pregnancy and birth outcomes, diabetes, and neurodevelopmental effects; and dose-response analysis characterizing the quantitative relationship for the noncancer outcomes listed above as well as for bladder cancer and lung cancer. These quantitative relationships are then used to derive cancer and non-cancer toxicity values (e.g., oral slope factor, reference dose). The SAB Inorganic Arsenic Review Panel will consider whether the conclusions found in the EPA's draft assessment are clearly presented and scientifically supported.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are revising our proposed designation of critical habitat for the Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. In response to new information we received and public comments on our June 10, 2020, proposed rule, we are now proposing to designate approximately 1,174,011 acres (475,105 hectares) in 13 Florida counties as critical habitat for the species. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the revised proposed designation of critical habitat for the Florida bonneted bat. We request comments from all interested parties on this revised proposed rule and the associated DEA. Comments submitted on our June 10, 2020, proposed rule need not be resubmitted as they will be fully considered in the preparation of the final rule. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species' critical habitat.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations regarding fitness for duty (FFD) programs for certain NRC licensees and other entities to align the NRC's drug testing requirements more closely with the updates made to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' "Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs" in 2008 and as revised in 2017. This final rule also incorporates lessons learned from implementing the NRC's current FFD regulations. These changes enhance the ability of NRC licensees and other entities to identify individuals using illegal drugs, misusing legal drugs, or attempting to subvert the drug testing process. This final rule provides additional protections to individuals subject to drug testing and improves the clarity, organization, and flexibility of the NRC's FFD regulations. This final rule provides a new flexibility for the collection and drug testing of an oral fluid specimen as an alternative to the collection and testing of a urine specimen under direct observation conditions. The NRC also is issuing final implementation guidance for this final rule.

Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/22/2022-25291/yaw-maneuver-conditions-rudder-reversals
The FAA is adding a new load condition to the design standards for transport category airplanes. The new load condition requires such airplanes to be designed to withstand the loads caused by rapid reversals of the rudder pedals, and applies to transport category airplanes that have a powered rudder control surface or surfaces. This rule is necessary because accident and incident data show that pilots sometimes make rudder reversals during flight, even though such reversals are unnecessary and discouraged by flightcrew training programs. The current design standards do not require the airplane structure to withstand the loads that may result from such reversals. If the loads on the airplane exceed those for which it is designed, the airplane structure may fail, resulting in catastrophic loss of control of the airplane. This final rule aims to prevent structural failure of the rudder and vertical stabilizer that may result from these rudder reversals.

The Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act (CGBPA or the Act) mandated, as a consumer product safety rule, the child-resistance requirements for closures on portable gasoline containers published in the voluntary standard, ASTM F2517-05. ASTM F2517 was revised in 2015 and 2017, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) allowed those revisions to become mandatory pursuant to the Act. On September 1, 2022, the Commission received notice that ASTM F2517 has been revised again. In this direct final rule, the Commission evaluates the revised ASTM F2517-22e1 standard and finds that the revisions carry out the purposes of the CGBPA. Accordingly, pursuant to the Act, the 2022 revisions to the child-resistance requirements of ASTM F2517 will be incorporated into the mandatory standard for closures on portable gasoline containers. This direct final rule updates the Commission's regulation to reflect that the requirements for closures on portable gasoline containers must meet the requirements in ASTM F2517-22e1.

On February 1, 2023, FSIS intends to stop using the N60 excision sampling method to sample domestic beef manufacturing trimmings and bench trim for adulterant Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) (STEC) and Salmonella. FSIS intends to replace the N60 excision sampling method with a non-destructive surface sampling method that uses a cloth manual sampling device. FSIS has found that the cloth sampling method is as effective as the N60 excision sampling method at recovering organisms in beef manufacturing trimmings. Additionally, the cloth sampling method is faster and safer for FSIS inspection program personnel (IPP) to use because it does not require IPP to use hooks or knives to collect samples. Moreover, the cloth sampling method allows FSIS to sample without destroying product, which reduces food waste.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Model Duo Discus and Duo Discus T gliders. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as the airbrake becoming blocked or jammed in an extended position during high airspeed due to an incorrect adjustment on the airbrake system. This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the airbrake system and corrective action as necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This document contains an amended and restated Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program (VFC Program or Program) under Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) and a request for comment. The VFC Program is designed to encourage correction of fiduciary breaches by permitting persons to avoid potential Department of Labor (Department) civil enforcement actions and civil penalties if they voluntarily correct eligible transactions in a manner that meets the requirements of the Program. Based on its experience since the last revision of the Program in 2006, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has identified certain changes that will both simplify and expand the original VFC Program, thereby making the Program easier for, and more useful to, employers and others who wish to avail themselves of the relief provided by the Program. Specifically, the Program amendments add a self-correction feature, clarify some existing transactions eligible for correction under the Program, expand the scope of other transactions currently eligible for correction, and simplify certain administrative or procedural requirements for participation in and correction of transactions under the VFC Program.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) requests public input for NRCS to use to inform how NRCS will implement funds received under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to fund the deployment of climate-smart practices on US farms, ranches, and forestlands through four Farm Bill conservation programs. NRCS is also requesting input on funding to quantify carbon sequestration and carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions at the field scale. NRCS is specifically interested in public input and recommendations that NRCS can use to improve, expand, and/or build on scientifically-designed quantification systems to monitor and quantify improvements in soil carbon, reductions in nitrogen losses, and the reduction, capture, avoidance, or sequestration of carbon dioxide, methane, or nitrous oxide emissions, associated with agricultural production. In implementing the IRA, NRCS is interested in supporting program implementation and improving program delivery by effectively leveraging partners to increase outreach and expand access to underserved producers. This effort will help NRCS identify and prioritize process improvements for the delivery of funding made available under IRA and the overall administration of the NRCS conservation programs.

This final rule amends Federal Housing Administration (FHA) regulations to allow mortgagors the option to purchase private flood insurance on FHA-insured mortgages for properties located in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), in satisfaction of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (the FDPA). The FDPA, as amended, requires the owner of a property mapped in a SFHA, and located in a community participating in the National Flood Insurance Program, to purchase flood insurance as a condition of receiving a mortgage backed by the Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), or Federal Housing Administration (FHA). In consideration of public comments, HUD's experience implementing the program, and HUD's goals of aligning with the Biggert-Waters Act while mitigating risk and protecting taxpayers' funds, this final rule adopts HUD's November 23, 2020, proposed rule with minor changes.

NMFS announces that the quotas for the Atlantic surfclam and ocean quahog fisheries for 2023 will remain status quo. NMFS also suspends the minimum size limit for Atlantic surfclams for the 2023 fishing year. Regulations for these fisheries require NMFS to notify the public of the allowable harvest levels for Atlantic surfclams and ocean quahogs from the Exclusive Economic Zone even if the previous year's quota specifications remain unchanged. The 2023 quotas were previously announced as projected values. This action confirms the final quotas are unchanged from those projections. This action would not result in harm to these fisheries.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Carolina, through the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (NCDAQ), via a letter dated December 9, 2021. The SIP revision includes the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the North Carolina portion (hereinafter referred to as the Metrolina Area) of the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill NC-SC 1997 8-hour ozone maintenance area (hereinafter referred to as the "Charlotte NC-SC 1997 8-hour NAAQS Area"). The Charlotte NC-SC 1997 8-hour NAAQS Area is comprised of Cabarrus, Gaston, Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Rowan, and Union Counties and a portion of Iredell County (i.e., Coddle Creek and Davidson Townships) in North Carolina; and the Rock Hill Metropolitan Planning Organization boundary in York County, South Carolina. EPA is proposing to approve the Metrolina Area LMP because it provides for the maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS within the Metrolina Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period in 2034. The effect of this action would be to make certain commitments related to maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in the Metrolina Area federally enforceable as part of the North Carolina SIP.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) has procedures for establishing supervisory authority over a nonbank covered person based on a risk determination, which the Bureau recently amended in April 2022 (Updated Procedural Rule). The Updated Procedural Rule added a new process to the procedures, for the Bureau to consider making final decisions and orders in these proceedings public, in whole or in part. While the Bureau strongly believes in supervisory confidentiality, these particular decisions and orders present unique circumstances that implicate important public interests in transparency. The Updated Procedural Rule did not affect the confidentiality of supervisory examinations or other aspects of the supervisory process. The Bureau is making specific changes to that rule in response to comments, in order to clarify the standard that will govern whether a decision or order will be publicly released, as well as to give respondents in proceedings additional time to provide input on that issue.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piaggio Aviation S.p.A. (type certificate previously held by Piaggio Aero Industries S.p.A.) (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as corrosion in the bottom fuselage area of the cabin compartment due to inner and outer sides of fuselage skin panels of certain airplanes treated with the less effective primer. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the fuselage skin panels, visually inspecting the entire fuselage inner side skin if necessary, and taking any necessary corrective actions.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is correcting a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on October 1, 2018, which became effective on October 31, 2018. The final rule approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Connecticut to address SIP revisions submitted to meet moderate area nonattainment requirements for the 2008 ozone standard. The SIP revisions are for the Greater Connecticut and the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT moderate ozone nonattainment areas, and include these areas 2011 base year emissions inventories, an emissions statement certification, reasonable further progress (RFP) demonstrations, reasonably available control measures (RACM) analyses, motor vehicle emissions budgets, and contingency measures. This correction does not change any final action taken by EPA on October 1, 2018; today's action merely corrects the Clean Air Act (CAA) citation for moderate area contingency measures. We have determined that there is good cause for making today's rule final without prior proposal and opportunity for comment because we are merely correcting an incorrect citation in a previous action. Thus, notice and public procedure are unnecessary.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-01-09, which applies to certain Stemme AG Model Stemme S 10-VT and Model Stemme S 12 gliders. AD 2022-01-09 requires removing the affected freewheel clutch from service and prohibits the installation of affected parts. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-01-09, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to amend the definition of an affected part. This proposed AD would retain the requirements of AD 2022-01-09 for removing the affected freewheel clutch from service and continue to prohibit the installation of an affected part, and would amend the definition of an affected part and clarify the part installation prohibition. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

On October 28, 2022, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published in the Federal Register a document entitled "Request for Information (RFI) on Data Collection for Emergency Clinical Trials and Interoperability Pilot." This RFI, issued by OSTP in partnership with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), invited comments on how to optimize data collection for clinical trials carried out across a range of institutions and sites, both in emergency settings and in the pre- emergency phase. OSTP and ONC are seeking input on viable technical strategies to distribute clinical trial protocols and capture clinical trial data using common application programming interfaces (APIs). OSTP and ONC also seek information about whether there is value in a pilot or demonstration project to operationalize data capture in the near term, for example within 6-12 months of the close of comments on the RFI. In response to requests by prospective commenters that they would benefit from additional time to adequately consider and respond to the RFI, OSTP has determined that an extension of the comment period until January 27, 2023 is appropriate.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain MHI RJ Aviation ULC Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100 & 440), CL-600-2C10 (Regional Jet Series 700, 701 & 702), CL-600- 2C11 (Regional Jet Series 550), CL-600-2D15 (Regional Jet Series 705), CL-600-2D24 (Regional Jet Series 900), and CL-600-2E25 (Regional Jet Series 1000) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports from the supplier that sensing elements of the bleed air leak detection system were manufactured with insufficient salt fill, which can result in an inability to detect hot bleed air leaks. This proposed AD would require testing of all affected overheat detection sensing elements of the bleed air leak detection system, and replacement if necessary. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) PT6E-67XP model turboprop engines with serial number HP0194 and earlier. This proposed AD was prompted by multiple reports of engines failing to achieve required power (torque) during high power applications due to internal leaks in the bleed-off valves (BOVs). This proposed AD would require replacement of the compressor BOV assembly, replacement of the BOV orifice feed air tube assembly, and installation of a redesigned P3 probe snorkel, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2004-04-09, which applies to certain Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) JT15D-1, JT15D-1A, and JT15D-1B model turbofan engines. AD 2004- 04-09 requires a one-time borescope inspection (BSI) of the rear face of certain impellers for evidence of a machined groove or step, and repair or replacement of the impeller if a groove or step is found. Since the FAA issued AD 2004-04-09, the FAA was notified of an uncontained failure of an impeller installed on a P&WC JT15D-1A engine during takeoff and subsequent investigation by the manufacturer that discovered machining marks on the impeller. This proposed AD would require borescope fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) of the rear face of certain impellers for evidence of machining witness lines and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the impeller, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

Enforcement and Compliance (E&C), of the Department of Commerce (Commerce), administers the antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) AD/CVD trade remedy laws of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Section 773(e) of the Act provides for Commerce to address, in its antidumping calculations, the existence of a particular market situation (PMS), such that the cost of materials and fabrication do not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade. Commerce seeks public comments as it considers revisiting its PMS methodology and issuing a new regulation that would identify information that Commerce should take into consideration and should not take into consideration in determining whether a PMS exists that distorts the cost of production. Commerce also seeks comments as it considers adjustments to calculations when the amount of distortion in the cost of production caused by a PMS cannot be quantified based on the record before it.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing that on February 1, 2023, the Agency will expand its routine verification testing for six Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli that are adulterants (non-O157 STEC; O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, or O145), in addition to the adulterant Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7, to ground beef, bench trim, and other raw ground beef components in addition to raw beef manufacturing trimmings in official establishments. The raw ground beef components to be tested for these six non-O157 STEC, hereafter "other raw ground beef components," are: head meat, cheek meat, weasand (esophagus) meat, product from advanced meat recovery (AMR) systems, partially defatted chopped beef and partially defatted beef fatty tissue, low temperature rendered lean finely textured beef, and heart meat. Currently, FSIS tests only its beef manufacturing trimmings samples for these six non- O157 STEC and E. coli O157:H7. Otherwise, all other raw beef products are tested only for E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella. FSIS also will begin testing for these non-O157 STEC in ground beef samples that it collects at retail stores and in applicable samples it collects of imported raw beef products. Additionally, FSIS is responding to comments regarding the STEC testing expansion and the costs and benefits analysis (CBA), as well as its updated STEC laboratory testing criteria for determining whether a result is positive.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or FWS), propose to revise the rule for the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) promulgated under section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). The intended purposes are threefold: To increase protection for African elephants in light of the recent rise in international trade of live African elephants by establishing ESA enhancement permit requirements for international trade in live elephants and specific enhancement requirements for the import of wild- sourced elephants, as well as requirements to ensure that proposed recipients of live African elephants are suitably equipped to house and care for them; to clarify the existing enhancement requirement during our evaluation of an application for a permit to import African elephant sport-hunted trophies; and to incorporate a Party's designation under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) National Legislation Project into the decision-making process for the import of live African elephants, African elephant sport-hunted trophies, and African elephant parts and products other than ivory and sport-hunted trophies. We anticipate these measures will affect implementation in foreign countries of management measures that enhance African elephant conservation.

FRA is amending its Safety Glazing Standards for exterior windows on railroad equipment to codify long-standing waivers, add a new testing option to improve consistency of glazing testing, and revise outdated section headings. The changes update and clarify existing requirements to maintain and, in some cases, enhance safety, while reducing unnecessary costs. Codification of the waivers is also consistent with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and will enable FRA to use its inspection resources more efficiently.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Embraer S.A. Model EMB-545 airplanes. This AD was prompted by an error that was detected in the airplane takeoff configuration warning logic. The error prevents the system from sounding an aural alert "No Takeoff Trim" for the flightcrew. This AD requires the installation of a new software version of engine indication and crew alert system (EICAS), as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is amending the patent rules of practice to provide that the receipt date of correspondence officially submitted electronically by way of the USPTO patent electronic filing system is the date in the Eastern time zone of the United States (Eastern Time) when the USPTO received the correspondence rather than the date on which the correspondence is received at the correspondence address in Alexandria, Virginia. This change is necessary because the USPTO is expecting to provide servers for receiving electronic submissions in locations that are separate from the USPTO headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. This change will ensure consistency and predictability with respect to correspondence receipt dates, as the date of receipt accorded to correspondence submitted electronically will not depend on the location of USPTO servers. The USPTO is also amending the patent rules of practice to make other clarifying changes regarding the receipt of electronic submissions, including providing a definition for Eastern Time. These changes harmonize the patent rules with the trademark rules and provide clarity regarding the date of receipt of electronic submissions.

This rulemaking finalizes, without change, the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA or Agency) 2019 interim final rule (RIN 3245-AH17) that adjusted monetary-based industry size standards (i.e., receipts- and assets-based) for inflation that occurred since 2014. This rulemaking also includes three interim final actions. First, SBA adds an additional 13.65 percent inflation increase to the monetary small business size standards, which have been recently adjusted as part of the second five-year review of size standards pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Jobs Act). This concurrent additional adjustment accounts for the inflation that has occurred since 2019 that has not been adequately addressed by the Agency's previous adjustments to its small business size standards under the Jobs Act. Second, this rulemaking adjusts three program-specific monetary size standards to account for inflation: the size standards for sales or leases of government property, the size standards for stockpile purchases, and alternative size standard based on tangible net worth and net income for the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program. Third, SBA adjusts for inflation the economic disadvantage thresholds applicable to the 8(a) Business Development and Economically Disadvantaged Women- Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) programs, and the dollar limit for combined total 8(a) contracts.

This action proposes special conditions for the the Airbus Model A321neo XLR airplanes. These airplanes will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is an electronic flight-control system that provides flight-envelope protections. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing this rule to amend the CFR for purposes of ensuring these regulations reflect the provisions enacted under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ("2012 Act") and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ("2013 Act"). The 2012 Act made significant changes to the retirement benefits of Members of Congress (Members) or congressional employees who are first covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) after December 31, 2012. The 2012 Act decreased the FERS benefit accrual rate used in the FERS annuity calculation for congressional employees or Members first covered by FERS (or reelected with less than five years of FERS service) after December 31, 2012. The 2012 Act also increased the FERS employee contributions by 1.8 percentage points for Members first covered by FERS (or reelected with less than five years of FERS-covered service) after December 31, 2012.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this document to modify and supplement its proposed rule issued on January 11, 2021, in which the Agency proposed updates and adjustments to the 2018 Fee Rule established under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). With over five years of experience administering the TSCA amendments of 2016, EPA is publishing this document to ensure that the fees charged accurately reflect the level of effort and resources needed to implement TSCA in the manner envisioned by Congress when it reformed the law. Additionally, the purpose of this document is to propose narrowing certain proposed exemptions for entities subject to the EPA-initiated risk evaluation fees and propose exemptions for the test rule fee activities; to propose modifications to the self- identification and reporting requirements for EPA-initiated risk evaluation and test rule fees; to propose a partial refund of fees for premanufacture notices withdrawn at any time after the first 10 business days during the assessment period of the chemical; to propose modifications to EPA's proposed methodology for the production volume- based fee allocation for EPA-initiated risk evaluation fees in any scenario where a consortium is not formed; to propose expanding the fee requirements to companies required to submit information for test orders; to propose modifying the fee payment obligations to require payment by processors subject to test orders and enforceable consent agreements (ECA); to propose extending the timeframe for test order and test rule payments; as well as to propose changes to the fee amounts and the estimate of EPA's total costs for administering TSCA.

Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/16/2022-24874/safety-and-effectiveness-of-certain-naloxone-hydrochloride-drug-products-for-nonprescription-use
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is announcing our preliminary assessment that certain types of naloxone hydrochloride ("naloxone") drug products may be approvable as safe and effective for nonprescription use. It is our preliminary opinion at this time that naloxone nasal spray up to 4 milligrams (mg), and naloxone autoinjector for intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) use up to 2 mg, have the potential to be safe and effective for use as directed in nonprescription drug labeling without the supervision of a healthcare practitioner. We believe the prescription requirement for these naloxone products might not be necessary for the protection of the public health. However, we need additional data such as product- specific data on the nonprescription user interface design, including packaging and labeling, to make a conclusive determination in this respect. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) does not permit the simultaneous marketing of the same drug with the same active ingredient as both a prescription and nonprescription product, absent a clinically meaningful difference between them. Therefore, if and when FDA has sufficient data to support approval of a nonprescription naloxone product (e.g., through submission and approval of an application for a nonprescription naloxone product or a supplemental application to switch an FDA-approved naloxone product from prescription to nonprescription status), currently marketed naloxone products labeled as "Rx only" with no clinically meaningful difference from the approved nonprescription products will be considered misbranded.

Through this notice, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces actions to ensure its continued compliance with the preliminary injunction order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. October 3, 2018) ("Ramos") and with the order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to stay proceedings in Bhattarai v. Nielsen, No. 19-cv-00731 (N.D. Cal. March 12, 2019) ("Bhattarai"). Beneficiaries under the existing Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Nepal, the 2011 designation of Haiti, and the 2013 designation of Sudan will retain their TPS while the preliminary injunction in Ramos and the Bhattarai orders remain in effect, provided that their TPS is not withdrawn because of individual ineligibility. They may also apply under the more recent designations of Haiti and Sudan in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and if granted, will retain TPS in accordance with their grants regardless of any potential end to the Ramos injunction. Other individuals who have been newly granted TPS under the 2021 designation of Haiti and the 2022 designation of Sudan, but who did not have TPS at the time of those designations, are not covered by this litigation compliance notice. Their TPS grants remain valid in accordance with their individual notices of approval from USCIS. This notice further provides information on the automatic extension of the validity of TPS-related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs); Notices of Action (Forms I-797); and Arrival/ Departure Records (Forms I-94), (collectively "TPS-related documentation") for those beneficiaries under the TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, Honduras, and Nepal.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission" or "SEC") is proposing a new rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") to prohibit registered investment advisers ("advisers") from outsourcing certain services or functions without first meeting minimum requirements. The proposed rule would require advisers to conduct due diligence prior to engaging a service provider to perform certain services or functions. It would further require advisers to periodically monitor the performance and reassess the retention of the service provider in accordance with due diligence requirements to reasonably determine that it is appropriate to continue to outsource those services or functions to that service provider. We also are proposing corresponding amendments to the investment adviser registration form to collect census-type information about the service providers defined in the proposed rule. In addition, we are proposing related amendments to the Advisers Act books and records rule, including a new provision requiring advisers that rely on a third party to make and/or keep books and records to conduct due diligence and monitoring of that third party and obtain certain reasonable assurances that the third party will meet certain standards.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Viking Air Limited (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-3 airplanes. This AD was prompted by multiple recent reports of cracks in the left-hand elevator auxiliary spar. This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections of the entire left-hand elevator auxiliary spar for cracks, corrosion, and previous repairs, and depending on the findings, replacement of the left-hand elevator auxiliary spar. This AD also requires sending the inspection results to the FAA. The FAA previously sent an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these airplanes and is now issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2022-02, "Operational Leakage." This RIS clarifies the NRC staff's position on the NRC requirements for evaluation, control, and treatment of operational leakage in systems required to be operable by plant technical specifications (TS). This RIS is intended for all holders of operating licenses and combined licenses for nuclear power reactors, except those who have permanently ceased operations and have certified that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel. This RIS emphasizes that operational leakage must be addressed in the same manner as leakage detected during an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (BPV) Code, Section XI, pressure test. That is, when operational leakage is found in a system that is within the scope of ASME BPV Code, Section XI, and is required to be operable by plant TS, the component must be evaluated by the licensee for operability. Structural integrity determinations must be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of the original construction code, the ASME BPVC, Section XI, or otherwise addressed through authorized methods.

Amendments to regulations regarding the definition of Vietnam era and the retention of eligibility to DIC benefits following the remarriage of a surviving spouse after a certain age bring federal regulations into conformance with the statutory changes. Similarly, the Medal of Honor special pension regulatory amendments extend eligibility for that benefit to a surviving spouse of a Medal of Honor recipient as required by law.

The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy (OIDP) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) announces the draft targets for updating the Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) National Action Plan, Phase 1, Acute Care Hospitals, for public comment. The HHS Core Group of the HAI National Action Plan reviewed data pre-pandemic and between 2020 and 2021 and developed potential 5-year targets based on assumptions that current HAI rates should return to pre-pandemic baseline rates within 2 years or within 3 years when determining these 5-year targets. The HHS HAI NAP Core Group recommends 5-year targets assuming a return to pre-pandemic baseline rates within 3 years based on two fundamentals: (1) pandemic-related challenges will likely persist in upcoming years, and (2) the pandemic has caused major strains on the health care system which make a 3-year timeline to achieve pre-pandemic Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) the most appropriate choice. The draft targets are below.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks to maximize the use of American-made products and materials in all federally funded projects as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's implementation of the Build America, Buy America Act (the Act), which was included in the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The implementation of this law will transform DOT's approach to domestic procurement requirements and is designed to drive significant investment in domestic manufacturing, spur job creation and grow the economy. The Department is taking three concurrent actions: (1) DOT is not extending its temporary waiver for construction materials, making that requirement applicable effective November 10, 2022; (2) in a separate notice, DOT is proposing a narrow waiver for de minimis costs, small grants, and minor components; and (3) in this notice, DOT is proposing to take two actions to help transition to the new construction materials standard. First, for DOT awards obligated on or after the effective date of the final waiver, DOT is proposing to waive the construction materials requirements for any contracts entered into before November 10, 2022. Second, DOT is proposing to waive the construction materials requirements for any contracts entered into before March 10, 2023, that result from solicitations published before May 14, 2022.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving and announcing the availability of the latest version of the California EMFAC (short for EMission FACtor) model for use in state implementation plan (SIP) development and transportation conformity in California. EMFAC2021 is the latest update to the EMFAC model for use by California state and local governments to meet Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements. The new model, which is based on new and improved data and new and amended regulations in California, calculates air pollution emissions factors for passenger cars, trucks, motorcycles, motor homes, and buses. The EPA is also approving EMFAC2017 adjustment factors, which are based on these same new regulations, for those areas that have already begun SIP development with EMFAC2017. This notice also sets the date after which EMFAC2021, rather than EMFAC2017 or the EMFAC2017 adjustment factors discussed in this notice, must be used to satisfy the requirement that conformity determinations be based on the latest emissions model available. Because the EMFAC model is used only in California, this notice does not affect the applicability of the Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) model for users in other states.

Source: Federal Register

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring David Elias Mendoza for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Mendoza engaged in a pattern of importing or offering for import misbranded drugs (i.e., in an amount, frequency, or dosage that is inconsistent with his personal or household use) that are not designated in an authorized electronic data interchange system as products regulated by FDA. Mr. Mendoza was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of March 28, 2022 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Mendoza had not responded. Mr. Mendoza's failure to respond and request a hearing within the timeframe prescribed by regulation constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing and any contentions concerning this matter.

The FDIC, as part of its obligations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), invites the general public and other Federal agencies to take this opportunity to comment on the survey collection instrument for its eighth biennial survey of households, which has been renamed the FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households (Household Survey). This survey was previously named the Survey of Household Use of Banking and Financial Services and is assigned OMB Control No. 3064-0215. The 2023 Household Survey is scheduled to be conducted in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau as a supplement to its June 2023 Current Population Survey (CPS). The survey collects information on U.S. households' use of bank accounts, prepaid cards, nonbank online payment services and other nonbank financial transaction services, and bank and nonbank credit. The results of these biennial surveys will be published by the FDIC, and help inform policymakers, bankers, and researchers about bank account ownership and household use of the banking system and nonbank financial products and services to meet their financial needs.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) GE90-76B, GE90-85B, GE90-90B, and GE90-94B model turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a commanded in-flight shutdown (IFSD) due to cracking and rockback of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) stage 2 nozzles resulting in blade liberation, severe rotor imbalance, and liberation of the exhaust centerbody. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive borescope inspections (BSIs) of the forward platforms of the HPT stage 2 blades or the leading edges of the HPT stage 2 nozzles and, depending on the results of the inspections, removal and replacement of the HPT stage 2 nozzles with a part eligible for installation. As a mandatory terminating action to the repetitive BSIs of the forward platforms of the HPT stage 2 blades or the leading edges of the HPT stage 2 nozzles, this proposed AD would require replacement of the HPT stage 2 nozzles. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

After rules were published on August 3, 2020, providing that registered patent practitioners and persons granted limited recognition to practice in patent matters before the USPTO would be permitted to voluntarily certify completion of CLE to the Director of the Office of Enrollment and Discipline (OED Director) and that the OED Director could publish whether such persons had voluntarily certified, the USPTO indefinitely delayed implementation of the voluntary CLE certification. After receiving and considering stakeholder feedback on the certification process and possible details regarding implementation, the USPTO has determined that it will not implement the voluntary CLE certification program at this time.

This AD requires installing a placard and stowing the fire gloves on the left-hand (LH) flap door of the flight deck step; and installing the placards on the LH and right-hand (RH) flight deck stowage boxes. This AD also requires revising the operator's existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include emergency procedures, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference.

EPA determined that methylene chloride, as a whole chemical substance, presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health when evaluated under its conditions of use. In addition, this revised risk determination does not reflect an assumption that workers always appropriately wear personal protective equipment (PPE). EPA understands that there could be occupational safety protections in place at workplace locations; however, not assuming use of PPE reflects EPA's recognition that unreasonable risk may exist for subpopulations of workers that may be highly exposed because they are not covered by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, or their employers are out of compliance with OSHA standards, or because many of OSHA's chemical- specific permissible exposure limits largely adopted in the 1970's are described by OSHA as being "outdated and inadequate for ensuring protection of worker health," or because the OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) alone may be inadequate for ensuring protection of worker health, or because EPA finds unreasonable risk for purposes of TSCA notwithstanding OSHA requirements. This revision supersedes the condition of use-specific no unreasonable risk determinations in the June 2020 Methylene Chloride Risk Evaluation and withdraws the associated TSCA order included in the June 2020 Methylene Chloride Risk Evaluation.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/10/2022-24430/airworthiness-directives-leonardo-spa-helicopters
The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model AB139 and AW139 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a damaged tail rotor duplex bearing (TRDB). This proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting certain TRDBs and depending on the results, replacing the TRDB or tail rotor actuator (TRA), or as an option, replacing the sliding control assembly. This proposed AD would also require replacing an affected TRDB with a serviceable TRDB at a specified threshold and prohibit the installation of certain TRDBs or sliding control assemblies on any helicopter, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Coast Guard announces the availability, in the docket, of a draft guidance document intended to establish a new, nationally consistent architecture for coastal zone Area Contingency Plans (ACPs). ACPs are required by the Clean Water Act and demonstrate the planning for oil and hazardous substance incident response at the local level. ACPs for areas within the coastal zone are approved by the Coast Guard. To modernize coastal ACPs, improve usability and attain national consistency the Coast Guard is developing new policy pertaining to ACP architecture. This new, standardized construct will better enable industry plan writers of vessel and facility response plans with multiple, diverse operating areas to consistently align with Coast Guard approved ACPs. A more standardized approach will minimize confusion due to highly variable ACP structure and content and will also facilitate more efficient response, especially for large sale responses requiring mobilization of personnel and resources from outside the region. Additionally, adopting a nationally consistent architecture will facilitate the Coast Guard's development of more modern, app-based ACP products for end users.

NMFS is implementing a 2,000-lb (907.2-kg) possession limit for Atlantic herring for Management Area 1A. This is required because NMFS projects that herring catch from Area 1A will reach 92 percent of the Area's sub-annual catch limit before the end of the fishing year. This action is intended to prevent overharvest of herring in Area 1A, which would result in additional catch limit reductions in a subsequent year.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-14-14, which applies to all Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Co. Segelflugzeugbau Model ASW-15 gliders. AD 2022-14-14 requires repetitively inspecting the wing root ribs for cracks, looseness, and damage and replacing any root rib with a crack, a loose rib or lift pin bushing, or any damage. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-14-14, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to add all Model ASW-15B gliders to the applicability. This proposed AD is prompted by MCAI originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. This proposed AD would retain the requirements from AD 2022-14-14 of repetitively inspecting the wing root ribs for cracks, looseness, and damage and replacing any root rib with a crack, a loose rib or lift pin bushing, or any damage; and would add the Model ASW-15B gliders to the applicability.

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 123 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI FMP) to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review. If approved, Amendment 123 would amend regulations governing Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) (halibut) prohibited species catch (PSC), or bycatch, limits in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) to link the halibut PSC limit for the Amendment 80 commercial groundfish trawl fleet in the BSAI groundfish fisheries to halibut abundance. This action is necessary to comply with the requirements of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). In particular, National Standard 9 and National Standard 1 require fishery management plans to minimize halibut PSC to the extent practicable while achieving optimum yield in the BSAI groundfish fisheries on a continuing basis. Further, National Standard 4 requires fishery management plans to ensure that when it becomes necessary to allocate or assign fishing privileges among various U.S. fishermen, such allocation shall be fair and equitable, reasonably calculated to promote conservation, and carried out in such manner that no particular individual, corporation, or other entity acquires an excessive share of such privileges. National Standard 8 requires that conservation and management measures take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities by utilizing economic and social data that are based upon the best scientific information available in order to provide for the sustained participation of such communities and, to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities. Amendment 123 is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the BSAI FMP, and other applicable laws.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is establishing a specific listing and DEA Chemical Control Number for tert-butyl 4- (phenylamino)piperidine-1-carboxylate (also known as 1-boc-4-AP; and CAS Number: 125541-22-2) and its salts as a list I chemical under the Controlled Substances Act. Although 1-boc-4-AP is not specifically listed as a list I chemical of the Controlled Substances Act with its own unique Chemical Control Number, it has been regulated as a list I chemical in the United States since May 15, 2020, as a carbamate of N- phenylpiperidin-4-amine, a list I chemical. Therefore, DEA is simply amending the list I chemicals list in its regulations to include a separate listing for 1-boc-4-AP, a currently controlled list I chemical.

This proposed AD was prompted by the exclusion of life limits for certain compressor cases and compressor drums from the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the engine maintenance manual (EMM). This proposed AD was also prompted by certain compressor cases that, following rework, were improperly re-identified and the engine logbook entries were not completed. This proposed AD would require recalculation of the consumed life for the affected compressor cases and compressor drums and, depending on the results of the recalculation, removal and replacement of the affected compressor case or compressor drum with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

On May 5, 2022, HUD previously issued a separate waiver covering all FFA obligated by HUD on or before November 14, 2022, including Community Development Block Grant ("CDBG") formula grants. In order to fully focus on the successful implementation of the BAP in CDBG formula grants, one of HUD's largest grant programs, HUD has determined that it is in the public interest to propose a new public interest waiver of the application of the BAP for all other FFA provided by HUD. HUD is proposing that this waiver cover all FFA obligated by HUD during the ninety (90) day period after its effective date except for those funds utilized in connection with the purchase of iron or steel products in infrastructure projects funded by CDBG formula grants obligated by HUD on or after November 15, 2022. In addition, in the case of FFA obligated by HUD on or after November 15, 2022, but prior to the effective date of the final waiver, the waiver will apply to all expenditures incurred on or after the date of the final waiver, except for those funds utilized in connection with the purchase of iron or steel products in infrastructure projects funded by CDBG formula grants obligated by HUD on or after November 15, 2022. HUD is also, through this waiver, soliciting specific comment on the further phased implementation of the BAP in connection with the iron and steel products used in other non-CDBG formula grant FFA provided by HUD and in the full implementation of the BAP in connection with the use of construction materials and manufactured products in all infrastructure projects across HUD's FFA programs.

In doing so, EPA is specifying that the listing also includes those chitosan salts that can be formed when chitosan is mixed with the acids that are listed as active or inert ingredients eligible for use in minimum risk pesticide products.

Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/08/2022-23978/nitric-acid-exemption-from-the-requirement-of-a-tolerance
This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of nitric acid (CAS Reg. No. 7697-37-2) when used as an inert ingredient (pH adjuster) applied to crops and raw agricultural commodities pre- and post-harvest, limited to no more than 10% by weight in the pesticide formulation. Technology Sciences Group, Inc. on behalf of Organisan Corporation, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of nitric acid when used in accordance with the terms of the exemption.

Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/07/2022-23567/airworthiness-directives-pilatus-aircraft-ltd-airplanes
The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pilatus Aircraft Ltd. (Pilatus) Model PC-12/47E airplanes. This proposed AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as corrosion of the actuator attachment lug areas underneath the anti-rotation pads of the main landing gear (MLG) and nose landing gear (NLG). This proposed AD would require replacing certain MLG and NLG electro-mechanical actuators. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce revisions to the critical habitat we proposed on October 19, 2021, for the federally endangered Southern Sierra Nevada distinct population segment (DPS) of fisher (Pekania pennanti) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). As a result of the critical habitat revisions, we now propose to designate a total of approximately 595,495 acres (240,988 hectares) as critical habitat for the Southern Sierra Nevada DPS of fisher across six units (one unit of which is further subdivided into two subunits) in California. This amounts to an overall increase of 41,041 acres (16,609 hectares) in our proposed critical habitat designation for the DPS, which includes revisions to all six units. We invite interested parties to comment on the revisions described in this document. Comments previously submitted on the October 19, 2021, proposed rule need not be resubmitted, as they will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule.

A Returned Deposited Item is a check that a consumer deposits into their checking account that is returned to the consumer because the check could not be processed against the check originator's account. Blanket policies of charging Returned Deposited Item fees to consumers for all returned transactions irrespective of the circumstances or patterns of behavior on the account are likely unfair under the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau or CFPB) is issuing this bulletin to notify regulated entities how the Bureau intends to exercise its enforcement and supervisory authorities on this issue.

[FEDERAL REGISTER PAGE 40-60] 2022-11-07 00:00:00Z | Notice of Intent To Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Mid-Chesapeake Bay Islands Ecosystem Restoration Project at James Island
Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/07/2022-24164/notice-of-intent-to-prepare-a-supplemental-environmental-impact-statement-for-the-mid-chesapeake-bay
Pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, the Baltimore District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), in partnership with the Maryland Department of Transportation's Maryland Port Administration, the non- federal sponsor, plans to prepare a supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (sEIS) for the Mid-Chesapeake Bay Island Ecosystem Restoration Project at James Island (Mid-Bay Island Project). The Mid- Chesapeake Islands Restoration Project recommends remote island restoration at James Island and Barren Island, both on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and in Dorchester County, MD, through the beneficial use of dredged material. The project addresses two needs: (1) the restoration of remote island habitat to benefit wildlife including a diverse assemblage of birds, fish, herpetofauna, and invertebrates; and (2) the beneficial use of dredged material from the maintenance of the approach channels to Baltimore Harbor. Remote islands, a critical ecosystem component in the Chesapeake Bay, are offshore landforms that provide isolation, lack of human disturbance, and few predators. These conditions uniquely support isolated nesting and foraging habitat for a diverse assemblage of wildlife. Extensive island habitat loss has occurred within the Mid-Chesapeake Bay, and James Island has nearly vanished. Sea level rise and related erosion, as well as land subsidence and wave action are the primary drivers of island loss. The project provides an opportunity to utilize 30 to 70 million cubic yards of clean dredged material over a 20-year period to restore 2,072 acres of remote island habitat at James Island including uplands and wetlands. The project would convert over 2,000 acres of shallow water habitat in the waters surrounding James Island to external dikes and island habitat. There are expected to be long-term changes to the aesthetics of the project area as an effect of the restoration of James Island in the landscape. The sEIS will update documentation for NEPA focused on the James Island component of the project. USACE is requesting to be provided any supporting information, analyses, and alternative identification relevant to the action being evaluated by this sEIS.

This final rule sets forth routine updates to the Medicare home health payment rates for calendar year (CY) 2023 in accordance with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. This final rule also finalizes a methodology for determining the impact of the difference between assumed versus actual behavior change on estimated aggregate expenditures for home health payments as result of the change in the unit of payment to 30 days and the implementation of the Patient Driven Groupings Model (PDGM) case-mix adjustment methodology and finalizes a corresponding permanent prospective adjustment to the CY 2023 home health payment rate. This rule finalizes the reassignment of certain diagnosis codes under the PDGM case-mix groups, and establishes a permanent mitigation policy to smooth the impact of year-to-year changes in home health payments related to changes in the home health wage index. This rule also finalizes recalibration of the PDGM case-mix weights and updates the low utilization payment adjustment (LUPA) thresholds, functional impairment levels, comorbidity adjustment subgroups for CY 2023, and the fixed-dollar loss ratio (FDL) used for outlier payments. Additionally, this rule discusses comments received on the future collection of data regarding the use of telecommunications technology during a 30-day home health period of care on home health claims. This rule also finalizes changes to the Home Health Quality Reporting Program (HH QRP) requirements; changes to the expanded Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model; and updates to the home infusion therapy services payment rates for CY 2023.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is issuing a final order to reclassify human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load monitoring tests, postamendments class III devices with the product code MZF, into class II (special controls), subject to premarket notification. Through this final order, FDA is also adding a new device classification regulation along with special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for this device type. The final order reclassifies this device type from class III (premarket approval) to class II (special controls) and will reduce the regulatory burdens associated with these devices because manufacturers will no longer be required to submit a premarket approval application (PMA) for this device type but can instead submit a less burdensome premarket notification (510(k)) and receive clearance before marketing their device.

Therefore, Commerce is publishing a notice of continuation of these AD and CVD orders.

The Coast Guard is issuing this final rule to extend the maximum validity period of merchant mariner medical certificates issued to first-class pilots, and masters or mates serving as pilot, from 2 years to 5 years. We are issuing this rule in response to federal advisory committee recommendations and a petition for rulemaking. This rule will reduce the frequency of medical certificate application submissions to the Coast Guard. The rule maintains the requirement for pilots to complete annual physicals and provides the Coast Guard opportunity to review the medical examinations of pilots who may become medically unqualified between medical certificate applications; therefore, the rule does not compromise safety.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/04/2022-23762/pork-promotion-research-and-consumer-information-order-decrease-in-assessment-rate-and-importer
Pursuant to the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act of 1985 (Act) and the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Order (Order) thereunder, this rulemaking decreases the current rate of assessment of 0.40 percent of the market value of live porcine animals to 0.35 percent and decreases the amount of assessment per pound due on imported pork and pork products (one- to three-hundredths of a cent per pound). These reductions in assessment rates are made in response to the approximately 47 percent increase in 2021 in the average prices of live hogs above its 3-year average from 2018-2020 and reflect the National Pork Producers Delegate Body's (Delegate Body) desire to lessen the assessment burden on producers and make such funds available to pork producers and the industry. The adjustment in importer assessments also brings the equivalent market value of live animals from which imported pork and pork products are derived in line with the market value of domestic porcine animals. This action also updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule number for prepared or preserved pork in the regulation.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) proposes to establish annual hunting regulations for certain migratory game birds for the 2023-24 hunting season. We annually prescribe outside limits (frameworks) within which States may select hunting seasons. This proposed rule provides the regulatory schedule and describes the proposed regulatory alternatives for the 2023-24 general duck seasons and preliminary proposals that vary from the 2022-23 hunting season regulations. Migratory bird hunting seasons provide opportunities for recreation and sustenance; aid Federal, State, and Tribal governments in the management of migratory game birds; and permit harvests at levels compatible with migratory game bird population status and habitat conditions.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Viking Air Limited (Viking) (type certificate previously held by Bombardier Inc. and de Havilland, Inc.) Model DHC-3 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a recent investigation of a Viking Model DHC-3 airplane where the lock ring of the stabilizer actuator was found missing. This AD requires a visual inspection of the stabilizer actuator to confirm that the stabilizer actuator lock ring is present, correctly seated in the groove in the upper housing, and engaged in the clamp nut, applicable corrective actions, and application of a torque seal. This AD also requires sending the inspection results to the FAA. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making a determination that the the Anne Arundel County and Baltimore County, Maryland sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) nonattainment area has attained the 2010 primary SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air quality standard (2010 SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS). Under EPA's Clean Data Policy, certain Clean Air Act (CAA) planning requirements are suspended for a nonattainment area when EPA issues a determination that air quality data demonstrate that the NAAQS is being attained. EPA deems these suspended CAA requirements as no longer applicable for as long as air quality continues to meet the NAAQS. EPA is also simultaneously approving elements of Maryland's January 31, 2020 state implementation plan (SIP) revision submittal containing an attainment plan for the Anne Arundel County and Baltimore County SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area (referred to hereafter as the Anne Arundel-Baltimore County Area, or simply the Area). The attainment plan elements EPA is approving are not suspended by a determination of attainment under EPA's Clean Data Policy, because EPA considers them independent of planning requirements that are designed to help the area attain the NAAQS. Finally, EPA is approving as SIP strengthening measures certain emission limit requirements on large SO<INF>2</INF> emission sources that were submitted as part of Maryland's attainment plan. This clean data determination (CDD) and partial approval of Maryland's attainment plan SIP revision does not constitute redesignation of the Area to attainment or full approval of the submitted attainment plan. This action is being taken under the CAA.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving elements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submission from Indiana regarding the infrastructure requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The infrastructure requirements are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA. EPA is also approving revisions to the Indiana SIP that would incorporate by reference a more recent edition of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). EPA proposed this action on June 29, 2022, and received no comments.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "S1B(R1) Addendum to S1B Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals." The guidance was prepared under the auspices of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), formerly the International Conference on Harmonisation. The final guidance expands the testing scheme for assessing human carcinogenic risk of pharmaceuticals by introducing an additional approach that is not described in the original S1B Guideline. The final guidance is intended to offer an integrative approach that provides specific weight of evidence criteria that inform whether a 2-year rat study is likely to add value in completing a human carcinogenicity risk assessment. The Addendum also adds a plasma exposure ratio-based approach for setting the high dose in the rasH2-Tg mouse model, while all other aspects of the recommendations for high-dose selection in ICH guidance for industry "S1C(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals" still apply.

This notice seeks public comment on a proposed update to the Periodicity Schedule of the Bright Futures Recommendations for Pediatric Preventive Health Care ("Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule"), as part of the HRSA-supported preventive service guidelines for infants, children, and adolescents. Please see https:// mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-topics/child-health/bright- futures.html for additional information. Specifically, the proposed update to the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule is to extend the upper age range for the existing universal Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening recommendation. In the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule, a "dot" with an "arrow" indicates a "range during which a service may be provided." In the current Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule, the age range recommended for which adolescents may be provided universal screening for HIV is between the 15-year visit and 18-year visit. The proposed update to the Bright Futures Periodicity Schedule would indicate that the recommended age range for which adolescents may be provided universal screening for HIV is between the 15-year visit and 21-year visit. The proposed update also includes an accompanying footnote to provide updated information from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) about more frequent screening for youth assessed as at high risk of HIV infection.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a revised draft guidance for industry entitled "Expanded Access to Investigational Drugs for Treatment Use: Questions and Answers." Since 2017, FDA has received many questions concerning implementation of the regulatory requirements of the expanded access program. In addition, FDA developed recommendations for fulfilling the new requirements for expanded access submissions promulgated in the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) (2016) and the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA). FDA is providing this guidance in a question-and- answer format, addressing the most recent frequently asked questions and sharing recommendations to fulfill the new statutory requirements. This guidance revises the guidance of the same title issued in June 2016 and updated in October 2017.

On January 7, 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule to renumber, rename, and rearrange certain subparts and sections in our regulations. In that rule, we incorrectly presented an amendatory instruction, which prevented the complete codification of the regulatory text we set forth for one section of the regulations. In this document, we correctly set forth the amendatory instruction and the relevant regulatory text. This technical amendment is a purely administrative action; it simply corrects one amendatory instruction to codify regulations we previously published in our January 7, 2022, final rule.

NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 23 to the Mackerel, Squid, and Butterfish Fishery Management Plan. Amendment 23 was developed by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council to establish a revised Atlantic mackerel rebuilding plan, set the 2023 Atlantic mackerel specifications and a river herring and shad catch cap for the Atlantic mackerel fishery, establish a recreational possession limit, and modify in-season closure measures. This action is necessary to prevent overfishing and rebuild the Atlantic mackerel stock based on a 2021 management track assessment that found the Atlantic mackerel stock remains overfished and subject to overfishing. The intended effect of this rule is to sustainably manage the Atlantic mackerel fishery and achieve optimum yield on a continuing basis.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-03-13, which applies to certain General Electric Company (GE) CT7- 5A2, CT7-5A3, CT7-7A, CT7-7A1, CT7-9B, CT7-9B1, CT7-9B2, CT7-9C, and CT7-9C3 model turboprop engines. AD 2018-03-13 requires initial and repetitive visual inspections and fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the main propeller shaft. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-03-13, the manufacturer detected two additional cracks on a main propeller shaft during its ongoing investigation and subsequently published service information that introduced reduced inspection thresholds for initial and repetitive visual inspections, FPIs, and added initial and repetitive ultrasonic inspections (USIs) of the main propeller shaft. Additionally, the manufacturer revised the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the maintenance manual (MM) to incorporate initial and repetitive USIs to inspect for cracks on the main propeller shaft. This proposed AD would require initial and repetitive visual inspections, FPIs, and USIs of the main propeller shaft. Depending on the results of these inspections, this proposed AD would require replacement of the main propeller shaft. As an optional terminating action to these inspections, this proposed AD would require revising the ALS of the existing MM and the operator's existing approved maintenance program or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate the tasks and reduced inspection thresholds for the main propeller shaft. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-23-17 for all Hoffmann GmbH & Co. KG (Hoffmann) model HO-V 72 propellers. AD 2021-23-17 required amending the existing aircraft flight manual (AFM) by inserting abnormal propeller vibration instructions, visual inspection and non-destructive test (NDT) inspection of the propeller hub and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the propeller hub with a part eligible for installation. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-23-17, further investigation by the manufacturer revealed that cracks found on propeller hubs likely resulted from propeller blade retention nuts that were not tightened using published service information during blade installation. This AD is prompted by reports of cracks at different positions on two affected propeller hubs. This AD retains the required actions of AD 2021-23-17. This AD also requires a maintenance records review and, depending on the results of the maintenance records review, tightening of each propeller blade retention nut to specific torque values. Depending on the results of the maintenance records review, this AD requires physically inspecting the propeller blade for shake. If any axial play is detected during the performance of the inspection, this AD requires the removal of the propeller from service and the performance of an NDT inspection of the propeller hub, and depending on the NDT inspection results, replacement of the propeller hub with a part eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Secretary establishes new regulations governing the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program to establish a new Federal standard and a process for determining whether a borrower has a defense to repayment on a loan based on an act or omission of their school. We also are amending the Direct Loan Program regulations to prohibit participating schools from using certain contractual provisions regarding dispute resolution processes and to require certain notifications and disclosures by institutions (institutions or schools) regarding their use of mandatory arbitration. Additionally, we are amending the Direct Loan regulations to eliminate interest capitalization in instances where it is not required by statute. We are also amending the regulations governing closed school discharges and total and permanent disability (TPD) discharges in the Federal Perkins Loan (Perkins), Direct Loan, and Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs. We are also amending the regulations governing false certification discharges in the Direct Loan and FFEL programs. Finally, we are amending the regulations governing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) in the Direct Loan program to improve the application process, and to clarify and expand definitions for full- time employment, qualifying employers, and qualifying monthly payments. The changes would bring greater transparency and clarity and improve the administration of Federal student financial aid programs to assist and protect students, participating institutions, and taxpayers.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is granting exemptions from certain portions of the acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling, and the general design criteria for emergency core cooling, containment heat removal, and atmosphere cleanup to allow the use of a risk-informed analysis to evaluate the effects of debris in containment following a loss-of-coolant accident for the Callaway Plant, Unit No. 1 (Callaway) located in Callaway County, Missouri. The exemptions are in response to a request dated March 31, 2021, from Union Electric Company, doing business as Ameren Missouri (the licensee) related to the licensee's proposed approach to resolve a generic safety concern for pressurized water reactors associated with potential clogging of emergency core cooling and containment spray system strainers during certain design basis events.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-08-02, which applies to all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Arriel 2D and Arriel 2E model turboshaft engines. AD 2021-08- 02 requires replacing certain critical parts before reaching their published in-service life limits, performing scheduled maintenance tasks before reaching their published periodicity, and performing unscheduled maintenance tasks when the engine meets certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-08-02, Safran has revised the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the existing maintenance and overhaul manuals, introducing new and more restrictive instructions and maintenance tasks. This proposed AD would require revisions to the ALS of the operator's existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP), as applicable, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering an exemption request from Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI) for the Indian Point Energy Center Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation. This exemption would, if granted, allow HDI to load up to three MPC-32Ms, using Amendment No. 15 for Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1014 for the HI-STORM 100 storage system, with either up to thirty-two fuel assemblies having either Californium (Cf-252) or Antimony-Beryllium (Sb-Be) neutron source assemblies (NSAs) with sufficient cooling time, or a combination of up to five fuel assemblies having primary Plutonium Beryllium (Pu-Be) NSAs and the remaining basket locations with fuel assemblies having either Cf-252 or Sb-Be NSAs with sufficient cooling time. As discussed further, the proposed exemption would permit HDI to load the fuel assemblies having either Cf-252 or Sb-Be NSAs in any location in the basket and the fuel assemblies having Pu-Be NSAs such that one is located in the center of the basket and one is located in each of the four basket quadrants. The NRC prepared an environmental assessment (EA) and concluded that the proposed action would have no significant environmental impact. Accordingly, the NRC staff is issuing a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemption.

EPA is proposing significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) and are also subject to Orders issued by EPA pursuant to TSCA. The SNURs require persons who intend to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) or process any of these chemical substances for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the use, under the conditions of use for that chemical substance, within the applicable review period. Persons may not commence manufacture or processing for the significant new use until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and has taken such actions as are required by that determination.

The FAA is withdrawing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that proposed to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 92-13-04 for certain Piper Aircraft Corporation (now Piper Aircraft, Inc.) (Piper) Model PA-23-150 (type certificated as PA-23) and PA-23-160 airplanes. AD 92-13-04 requires preflight water draining procedures for the fuel tanks on the affected airplanes. In June 2022, the FAA calculated the quantitative risk using current methods, which were not available at the time the NPRM and SNPRM were issued. The short- and long-term risk assessment calculations establish that an AD for the additional actions and the additional airplane models that were proposed to be added in the NPRM and SNPRM is not warranted. Accordingly, the NPRM and SNPRM are withdrawn.

In light of challenges faced by U.S. producers, USTR in coordination with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will establish a private-sector industry advisory panel to recommend measures to promote the competitiveness of producers of seasonal and perishable produce in the southeastern United States. Furthermore, USTR and USDA will work with the petitioners and producers to examine the issues raised in the petition and to consider any further actions that may be appropriate.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is correcting a document that was published in the Federal Register on September 12, 2022, regarding changes to maintain a consistent regulatory framework with the U.S. Department of Transportation for the domestic packaging and transportation of radioactive material and to ensure general accord with International Atomic Energy Agency standards. This action is necessary to make corrections in the estimated burden for the information collection and to make other corrections. The public comment period on the amended information collection was originally scheduled to close on November 14, 2022. The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period for the information collection to allow more time for members of the public to develop and submit their comments; the extended comment period for the information collection now aligns with the end of the general period for public comment.

As described in the recent RFI on Clinical Research Infrastructure and Emergency Clinical Trials, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in partnership with the National Security Council (NSC), is leading efforts to ensure that coordinated and large-scale clinical trials can be efficiently carried out across a range of institutions and sites as needed to address outbreaks of disease and other emergencies. In this RFI on Data Collection for Emergency Clinical Trials and Interoperability Pilot, issued in partnership with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), OSTP and ONC seek input on viable technical strategies to distribute clinical trial protocols and capture clinical trial data using common application programming interfaces (APIs), in the pre-emergency phase as well as in emergency settings. One specific objective for this RFI is to gather information about whether there is value in a pilot or demonstration project to operationalize data capture in the near term, for example within 6-12 months of the close of comments on this RFI.

The Coast Guard announces the availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed replacement of the BNSF Railway Bridge across the Missouri River between Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota. This was prepared in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and Council on Environmental Quality implementing regulations, and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). This final EIS evaluates the potential environmental consequences of permitting the replacement of the existing BNSF Railway Bridge across the Missouri River between the cities of Bismarck and Mandan, ND, or the construction of a bridge adjacent to the existing bridge. The applicant proposes to remove the existing structure, which is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The Coast Guard analyzed proposed alternatives, through the NEPA and NHPA processes, which included alternatives to construct the new bridge while retaining the existing bridge. The Coast Guard is making the final EIS available to the public on this docket. Section 4.0 of the final EIS identifies the preferred alternative, which is to construct a new bridge with 200-foot spans, and piers 20 feet upstream of the existing bridge, and to remove the existing structure.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 96- 12-11, which applies to all Canadair Model CL-215-1A10 airplanes. AD 96-12-11 requires repetitive inspections to detect discrepancies of the microswitches fitted at the water door actuator; replacement of any discrepant microswitch; and modification of the water door actuator switches, which terminates the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 96-12-11, it has determined that the corrective actions of that AD have not been effective at mitigating the risk of uncommanded opening of the water doors. This proposed AD would continue to require the modification of the water door actuator switches. This proposed AD would also require modification of the water door solenoid valve common grounds, add airplanes to the applicability, and prohibit installing certain water door solenoid valve selector assemblies. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

FMCSA announces its decision to grant the exemption requested by the National School Transportation Association (NSTA) for commercial driver's license (CDL) applicants seeking a school bus endorsement, from the engine compartment portion of the pre-trip vehicle inspection skills testing requirement, known as the "under-the-hood" testing requirement. Drivers issued a CDL pursuant to the requested exemption would be restricted to the intrastate operation of school buses only. FMCSA also grants an exemption from the requirement that states administer this portion of the pre-trip vehicle inspection test in accordance with an FMCSA pre-approved examiner information manual. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that granting the exemption is likely to achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety that would be obtained in the absence of the exemption.

NMFS closes the General category fishery for large medium and giant (i.e., measuring 73 inches (185 cm) curved fork length or greater) Atlantic bluefin tuna (BFT) for the October through November subquota time period. This action applies to Atlantic Tunas General category (commercial) permitted vessels and highly migratory species (HMS) Charter/Headboat permitted vessels with a commercial sale endorsement when fishing commercially for BFT. This action also waives the previously scheduled restricted-fishing days (RFDs) for the remainder of the October through November subquota time period. With the RFDs waived during the closure, fishermen aboard General category permitted vessels and HMS Charter/Headboat permitted vessels may tag and release BFT of all sizes, subject to the requirements of the catch- and-release and tag-and-release programs. On December 1, 2022, the fishery will reopen automatically.
