The FAA is revising an earlier proposed Airworthiness Directive (AD) for Bell Textron Inc. (Bell) Model 205B helicopters which proposed to require reducing the life limit of certain tail rotor (T/R) blades and re-identifying certain T/R blades with a new part number (P/N). The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was prompted by flight testing and fatigue analysis results. This action revises the NPRM by adding additional T/R part numbers (P/Ns) to the proposed applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over those in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these changes.

In March 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) released a Sixth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Sixth FNPRM) seeking comment on ways to stimulate expanded use of and investment in the 4.9 GHz (4940-4990 MHz) band, including allowing licensees the flexibility to engage in spectrum leasing and broadening existing eligibility requirements. On September 8, 2020, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau issued a Public Notice freezing the 4.9 GHz band to stabilize it while the Commission considered changes to the 4.9 GHz band rules (Freeze Public Notice). In this document, the Commission adopts rules permitting one statewide 4.9 GHz band licensee per state, the State Lessor, to lease some or all of its spectrum rights to third parties-- including commercial and public safety users--in those states that the Commission has not identified as a diverter of 911 fees. The Report and Order does not limit or modify the rights of any incumbent public safety licensees. The new rules also eliminate the requirement that leased spectrum must be used to support public safety but requires lessees to adhere to the informal coordination requirements applicable to the band.

NMFS issues this proposed rule to revise the annual reference points, including the overfishing limit (OFL), acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limit (ACL), for the central subpopulation of northern anchovy in the U.S. exclusive economic zone off the west coast under the Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan. NMFS prepared this rulemaking in response to a September 2020 court decision (Oceana, Inc. v. Ross et al.) that vacated the OFL, ABC, and ACL for the central subpopulation of northern anchovy and ordered NMFS to promulgate a new rule in compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and Administrative Procedure Act. NMFS is proposing an OFL of 119,153 metric tons (mt), an ABC of 29,788 mt, and an ACL of 25,000 mt. If the ACL for this stock is reached or projected to be reached, then fishing will be closed until it reopens at the start of the next fishing season. This rule is intended to conserve and manage the central subpopulation of northern anchovy off the U.S. West Coast.

In particular, this revised final guidance removes section VI.B. contained in the May 2018 guidance, regarding the "same product as another product" prescription drug program fee exception for certain prescription drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Corporation (RRC) AE 2100A, AE 2100D2, AE 2100D2A, and AE 2100P model turboprop engines. This AD was prompted by a report of a propeller gearbox (PGB) development test conducted by the manufacturer, in which high vibration occurred due to a fatigue crack that initiated in the PGB shaft and carrier assembly. This AD requires assignment of usage hours to the PGB shaft and carrier assembly at the next engine shop visit and replacement of PGB shaft and carrier assemblies prior to exceeding the new life limits established by the manufacturer. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is adopting amendments (the Final Rule) to Commission regulations on additional reporting by commodity pool operators (CPOs) and commodity trading advisors and to Form CPO-PQR (also, the form). The Commission is: Eliminating existing Schedules B and C of Form CPO-PQR, except for the Pool Schedule of Investments; amending the information requirements and instructions to request Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) for CPOs and their operated pools that have them, and to delete questions regarding pool auditors and marketers; and making certain other changes due to the rescission of Schedules B and C, including the elimination of all existing reporting thresholds. Pursuant to the Final Rule, all reporting CPOs will be required to file the revised Form CPO-PQR (Revised Form CPO-PQR, or the Revised Form) quarterly. The Final Rule also amends Commission regulations to permit reporting CPOs to file NFA Form PQR, a comparable form required by the National Futures Association (NFA), in lieu of filing the Commission's Revised Form. Conversely, Form PF will no longer be accepted in lieu of the Revised Form, though it will remain a Commission form.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-19-01, which applies to all Airbus Helicopters Model AS-365N2, AS 365 N3, EC 155B, EC155B1, SA-365N1, and SA-366G1 helicopters. AD 2018- 19-01 requires repetitive inspections of the aft fuselage outer skin. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-19-01, it was determined that Model SA- 365N helicopters are also affected by the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require repetitive inspections and would add Model SA-365N helicopters, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2001-16- 13, which applied to certain Airbus SAS Model A330 series airplanes. AD 2001-16-13 required a roto-test inspection of fastener holes of certain fuselage joints for cracks, reinforcement of the fuselage between certain frames, and, if necessary, a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection and repair. As published, the applicability of AD 2001-16-13 inadvertently identified the model designations as serial numbers. This document corrects that error. This new AD requires a roto-test inspection of fastener holes of certain fuselage joints for cracks, reinforcement of the fuselage, and, if necessary, an HFEC inspection and repair. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

On April 17, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Polyvinyl Chloride and Copolymers (PVC) Production at major and area sources. Subsequently, the Administrator received and granted petitions for reconsideration of the emission limits in the 2012 final rules for process vents, process wastewater, and stripped resin for major and area sources. In response to the petitions and after gathering additional information from PVC companies, the EPA is proposing revisions to emission limits in the 2012 major source rule for process vents and process wastewater. Although the EPA is not proposing revisions to emission limits in the 2012 area source rule, the EPA is proposing other amendments that affect both rules, including technical corrections and clarifications related to the standards for stripped resin, storage vessels (including the use of vapor balancing), equipment leaks, and closed vent systems. The EPA is also proposing to clarify text and correct typographical errors, grammatical errors, and cross-reference errors in both rules. In addition, the EPA is proposing to remove the affirmative defense provisions. We estimate that, if finalized, these proposed amendments would result in hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions reductions of 34 tons per year (tpy) with an annualized cost of $0.39 million.

This AD results from mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as movement of the aft fuel pipe within the coupling, which can cause damage to the O-rings and lead to a fuel leak, fuel fire or explosion, and consequent loss of control of the airplane. This AD requires replacing and prohibits installing affected parts. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH Model EC135P1, EC135T1, EC135P2, EC135T2, EC135P2+, EC135T2+, EC135P3, and EC135T3 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by a deviation from a new manufacturing process, which resulted in a reduced life limit (service life limit) for certain tail rotor blades. This proposed AD would require a reduced life limit for those tail rotor blades and require a new life limit for certain other tail rotor blades, as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC") is adopting amendments to the margin requirements for uncleared swaps for swap dealers ("SD") and major swap participants ("MSP") for which there is not a prudential regulator (the "CFTC Margin Rule"). Specifically, the CFTC Margin Rule mandated the collection and posting of variation margin and initial margin ("IM") under a phased compliance schedule extending from September 1, 2016, to September 1, 2020. The Commission is hereby amending the compliance schedule to further delay the compliance date for entities with smaller average daily aggregate notional amounts ("AANA") of swaps and certain other financial products (the "Smaller Portfolio Group") from September 1, 2021, to September 1, 2022, to avoid market disruption due to the large number of entities being required to comply by September 1, 2021, as a result of the adoption of the interim final rule ("Final Rule").

NMFS proposes a 2021 limit of 2,000 metric tons (t) of longline-caught bigeye tuna for each U.S. Pacific territory (American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) (the territories)). NMFS would allow each territory to allocate up to 1,500 t in 2021 to U.S. longline fishing vessels through specified fishing agreements that meet established criteria. However, the overall allocation limit among all territories may not exceed 3,000 t. As an accountability measure, NMFS would monitor, attribute, and restrict (if necessary) catches of longline-caught bigeye tuna, including catches made under a specified fishing agreement. The proposed catch limits and accountability measures would support the long-term sustainability of fishery resources of the U.S. Pacific Islands.

Counseling may include individualized discussion of healthy eating and physical activity. Under Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, as added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, non- grandfathered group health plans and non-grandfathered group and individual health insurance issuers must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services under that section, including those provided for in the Guidelines.

This action proposes to amend the Class D airspace, Class E surface Airspace and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Tacoma Narrows Airport, Tacoma, WA. A review of the airspace was initiated due to corresponding reviews at McChord Field (Joint Base Lewis-McChord) and Gray AAF (Joint Base Lewis-McChord). All three locations were evaluated at the same time due to their close proximity to one another and operational interdependence. After a review of the airspace, the FAA found it necessary to amend the existing airspace for the safety and management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at this airport.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is making technical amendments to its rules governing deposit insurance assessments in two places to conform regulatory text to the text that was adopted by the FDIC Board of Directors (FDIC Board). Due to publishing errors, incorrect text was printed in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations. The first amendment will conform the value of the weighted charge-off rate for loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties that appears in the FDIC's assessment regulations to the charge-off rate adopted by the FDIC Board. The second amendment will conform a footnote that defines two terms in the descriptions of the counterparty measures for purposes of deposit insurance assessments to the language adopted by the FDIC Board. The technical amendments will not affect assessments previously paid by insured depository institutions (IDIs) or assessments paid by IDIs in the future.

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Department of Commerce, maintains controls on the export, reexport and transfer (in- country) of dual-use items and less sensitive military items through the Export Administration Regulations, including the Commerce Control List (CCL). Certain items that could be of potential concern for export control purposes are not yet listed on the CCL or controlled multilaterally, because they represent emerging technologies. Among these items is "software" for the operation of nucleic acid assemblers and synthesizers controlled under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2B352 that is capable of designing and building functional genetic elements from digital sequence data. BIS has determined that this "software" is capable of being used to operate nucleic acid assemblers and synthesizers controlled under ECCN 2B352 for the purpose of generating pathogens and toxins without the need to acquire controlled genetic elements and organisms. Consequently, the absence of export controls on this "software" could be exploited for biological weapons purposes. In an effort to address this concern, this rule proposes to amend the CCL by adding a new ECCN 2D352 to control such "software." This rule also requests public comments to ensure that the scope of these proposed controls will be effective and appropriate (with respect to their potential impact on legitimate commercial or scientific applications).

This interim final rule with request for comments (IFC) discusses CMS's implementation of section 3713 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which established Medicare Part B coverage and payment for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and its administration. This IFC implements requirements in the CARES Act that providers of COVID-19 diagnostic tests make public their cash prices for those tests and establishes an enforcement scheme to enforce those requirements. This rule also establishes an add-on payment for cases involving the use of new COVID- 19 treatments under the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). This IFC provides for separate payment for new COVID-19 treatments under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) for the remainder of the PHE for COVID-19 when these treatments are provided at the same time as a Comprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification (C-APC) service. This rule also interprets and implements the requirement to maintain Medicaid beneficiary enrollment in order to receive the temporary increase in Federal funding in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). This IFC modifies policies of the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model and adds technical changes to accommodate these policy changes. Specifically, we are extending Performance Year (PY) 5 by adding 6 months, creating an episode-based extreme and uncontrollable circumstances COVID-19 policy, providing two reconciliation periods for PY 5, and adding DRGs 521 and 522 for hip and knee procedures. This rule also amends regulations regarding coverage of preventive health services to implement section 3203 of the CARES Act, which shortens the timeframe within which non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual health insurance coverage must begin to cover without cost sharing qualifying coronavirus preventive services, including recommended COVID-19 immunizations. This IFC also revises regulations to set forth flexibilities in the public notice requirements and post award public participation requirements for State Innovation Waivers under section 1332 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) during the public health emergency for COVID-19.

This final rule revises the current pesticide tolerance crop grouping regulations, which allow the establishment of tolerances for multiple related crops based on data from a representative set of crops. Specifically, the final rule revises one commodity definition, adds three new commodity definitions, and amends the current herbs and spices crop group currently provided in Crop Group 19. The crops in the current "Crop Group 19: Herbs and Spices Group" are separated into two new crop groups, "Crop Group 25: Herb Group" and "Crop Group 26: Spice Group" and additional commodities are added to Crop Groups 25 and 26. These revisions will increase the utility and benefit of the crop grouping system for producers and other stakeholders involved in commercial agriculture.

The proposed rule would replace general language allowing snowmobiles on unplowed roads and the shoulders of plowed roads with a comprehensive list of designated snowmobile routes. The proposed changes would provide greater certainty to the public by removing ambiguity in the current regulations about where snowmobiles are allowed. The use of snowmobiles within areas of the National Park System is prohibited except on routes and water surfaces designated by special regulation.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2018-07-16 for all Austro Engine GmbH model E4 and E4P diesel piston engines. AD 2018-07-16 required initial and repetitive replacement of the waste gate controller and the control rod circlip. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2018-07-16 and requires engine modification by installing a waste gate control-rod fail-safe bridge and new spring- loaded circlip that terminates the initial and repetitive replacement requirements of AD 2018-07-16. This AD was prompted by the development of a modification of the waste gate control rod by adding a fail-safe bridge and spring-loaded circlip. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This action revises the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by adding airplanes to the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that proposed in the NPRM, the FAA is reopening the comment period to allow the public the chance to comment on these proposed changes.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its regulations concerning beneficiary travel. The revisions would amend the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) beneficiary travel regulations to establish a new payment methodology for special modes of transportation. The new payment methodology would apply in the absence of a contract between VA and a vendor of the special mode of transportation. For transport by ambulance, VA proposes to pay the lesser of the actual charge or the amount determined by the Medicare Part B Ambulance Fee Schedule (AFS) established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). For travel by modes other than ambulance, VA proposes to establish a payment methodology based on states' posted rates or the actual charge. VA would replace this payment methodology for travel by modes other than ambulance at some time in the future, once VA has collected enough data to develop a new methodology.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is proposing rule and form amendments that would modernize the disclosure framework for open-end management investment companies. The disclosure framework would feature concise and visually engaging shareholder reports that would highlight key information that is particularly important for retail investors to assess and monitor their fund investments. Certain information that may be less relevant to retail investors--and of more interest to financial professionals and investors who desire more in-depth information--would no longer appear in funds' shareholder reports but would be available online, delivered free of charge upon request, and filed on a semi-annual basis on Form N-CSR. Funds' shareholder reports would serve as the central source of fund disclosure for existing shareholders. Thus, instead of delivering prospectus updates to existing shareholders each year, open-end funds would have an alternative way to keep shareholders informed. This framework would rely on the shareholder report (which would include a summary of material fund changes), along with timely notifications to shareholders about material fund changes as they occur and continued availability of the fund's prospectus. The Commission is also proposing amendments to open-end fund prospectus disclosure requirements to provide greater clarity and more consistent information about fees, expenses, and principal risks. Finally, the Commission is proposing amendments to the advertising rules for registered investment companies and business development companies to promote more transparent and balanced statements about investment costs.

This decision is supported at a programmatic level by the analysis in a Supplement Analysis (SA) to the Complex Transformation SPEIS (2019 SPEIS SA) (DOE/EIS-0236-SA-02), which NNSA prepared in 2019. After preparing and considering the 2019 SPEIS SA, NNSA has determined that no further NEPA analysis is needed at a programmatic level prior to issuing this Amended ROD.

Source: Federal Register

The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is amending its regulations governing the certification of agricultural labor or services to be performed by temporary foreign workers in H-2A nonimmigrant status (H-2A workers). Specifically, the Department is amending its regulations to revise the methodology by which it determines the hourly Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) for non-range agricultural occupations using wage data reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Labor Survey (FLS) and the Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey. This final rule improves the consistency and accuracy of the AEWRs based on the actual work being performed by H-2A workers, and establishes better stability and predictability for employers to comply with their wage obligations. These regulations are consistent with the Secretary of Labor's (Secretary) statutory responsibility to certify that the employment of H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. While the Department intends to address all of the remaining proposals from the July 26, 2019 proposed rule in a subsequent, second final rule governing other aspects of the certification of agricultural labor or services to be performed by H-2A workers and enforcement of the contractual obligations applicable to employers of such nonimmigrant workers, the Department focused this final rule on the immediate need for regulatory action to revise the methodology by which it determines the hourly AEWRs for non-range agricultural occupations before the end of the calendar year.

The OCC, Board, FDIC, NCUA, and Bureau (collectively, the agencies) are inviting comment on a proposed rule that would codify the Interagency Statement Clarifying the Role of Supervisory Guidance issued by the agencies on September 11, 2018 (2018 Statement). By codifying the 2018 Statement, the proposed rule is intended to confirm that the agencies will continue to follow and respect the limits of administrative law in carrying out their supervisory responsibilities. The 2018 Statement reiterated well-established law by stating that, unlike a law or regulation, supervisory guidance does not have the force and effect of law. As such, supervisory guidance does not create binding legal obligations for the public. The proposal would also clarify that the 2018 Statement, as amended, is binding on the agencies.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has determined that, for the 2021 quota year, the United Kingdom (UK) may designate importers to receive import licenses for specified quantities under certain dairy tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) allocated to the EU-27. In accordance with the definitions in Chapter 4 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), the UK continues to be eligible to export under dairy TRQ allocations to the EU-27. In previous years, the European Commission (EC) designated importers on behalf of the UK and all other eligible European Union (EU) Member States for dairy TRQ amounts reserved for designated licenses. However, the EC has informed the United States that it no longer has the authority to designate importers on behalf of UK exporters for trade transactions that will occur after December 31, 2020. Accordingly, the EU and the UK have each requested that the UK be permitted to designate importers for portions of certain dairy TRQs for the 2021 quota year. The USDA has agreed to the EU's and UK's requests.

On March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to the public health emergency (PHE) caused by the SARS- CoV-2 virus, otherwise known as COVID-19. The CARES Act was published in response to the PHE that requires "every laboratory that performs or analyzes a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19 shall report the results from each such test." The September 2, 2020 interim final rule with comment (CMS- 3401-IFC) requires laboratories to report SARS-CoV-2 test results in a manner and frequency specified by the Secretary. Consistent with the CARES Act laboratory reporting requirements, CMS made modifications to the CLIA regulations to meet the SARS-CoV-2 test result reporting provisions related to the Secretary's Public Health Emergency declaration with respect to COVID-19.

FMCSA announces its decision to grant, with conditions, Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc.'s (Knight-Swift) application for an exemption from the requirement that motor carriers rely on the motor vehicle record (MVR) of their drivers holding a commercial driver's license (CDL) as proof of the driver's medical qualifications when the driver undergoes a new medical exam during the initial period of employment as a condition of employment. Knight-Swift would rely on the medical long form for newly hired drivers and then rely on the MVR when the subsequent annual review of the driving record is performed. FMCSA analyzed the exemption application and public comments and determined that the applicant would achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on a draft Pesticide Registration Notice (PR Notice) entitled, "Draft List of Pests of Significant Public Health Importance--Revised 2020." PR Notices are issued by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to inform pesticide registrants and other interested persons about important policies, procedures, and registration related decisions, and serve to provide guidance to pesticide registrants and OPP personnel. This particular draft PR Notice provides guidance to the registrant concerning the proposal to update and replace the Pesticide Registration Notice (PRN) 2002-1, which identifies pests of significant public health importance. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that updating the list to reflect the current public health situation was warranted because vector-borne diseases and related research has changed significantly since the original PR Notice was published almost 20 years ago. This update includes the addition or removal of pests, new impacts, renaming pests, or grouping pests of similar species.

In addition, this rule proposes to classify continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) as DME under Medicare Part B and establish fee schedule amounts for these items and related supplies and accessories. Also, this proposed rule would expand the scope of the Medicare Part B benefit for DME by revising the interpretation of the "appropriate for use in the home" requirement in the definition of DME specifically for certain drugs or biologicals infused in the home using an external infusion pump.

The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS or the Agency), an agency of the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA or the Department), is issuing a final rule to add regulations that will ensure the integrity of the supplemental allotments created by Section 1101 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), as amended by the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act (CR) for households with children who would have otherwise received free or reduced price school meals under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, but for school closures or reduction in the number of days or hours that students attend school in response to the ongoing and national Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency. Such allotments are referred to as Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer (P- EBT) benefits. The CR extended the authority for P-EBT through Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, and also authorized P-EBT for households with at least one child enrolled in a covered child care facility (as defined by Section 1101(i)(1) of the FFCRA, as amended) and the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) when the covered child care facility is closed or has reduced attendance or hours or one or more schools in the area of the covered child care facility are closed or have reduced attendance or hours. This final rule would also safeguard the integrity of SNAP, as P-EBT operates within the SNAP infrastructure. USDA FNS is responsible for administering P-EBT and SNAP at the Federal level.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of the final Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) risk evaluation of Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl<INF>4</INF>). The purpose of conducting risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, including an unreasonable risk to a relevant potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors. EPA has determined that specific conditions of use of CCl<INF>4</INF> present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. For those conditions of use for which EPA has found an unreasonable risk, EPA must take regulatory action to address that unreasonable risk through risk management measures enumerated in TSCA. EPA has also determined that specific conditions of use do not present unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. For those conditions of use for which EPA has found no unreasonable risk to health or the environment, the Agency's determination is a final Agency action and is issued via order in the risk evaluation.

We are adopting amendments to certain procedural requirements and the provision relating to resubmitted proposals under the shareholder-proposal rule in order to modernize and enhance the efficiency and integrity of the shareholder-proposal process for the benefit of all shareholders. The amendments to the procedural rules: Amend the current ownership requirements to incorporate a tiered approach that provides three options for demonstrating a sufficient ownership stake in a company--through a combination of amount of securities owned and length of time held--to be eligible to submit a proposal; require certain documentation to be provided when a proposal is submitted on behalf of a shareholder-proponent; require shareholder- proponents to identify specific dates and times they can meet with the company in person or via teleconference to engage with the company with respect to the proposal; and provide that a person may submit no more than one proposal, directly or indirectly, for the same shareholders' meeting. The amendments to the resubmission thresholds revise the levels of shareholder support a proposal must receive to be eligible for resubmission at the same company's future shareholders' meetings from 3, 6, and 10 percent to 5, 15, and 25 percent, respectively.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires agencies to publish plans to conduct periodic reviews of certain of their regulations. Multiple Executive Orders also require agencies to submit plans for periodic reviews of certain regulations. To further comply with the RFA and Executive Orders, and to ensure the Department's regulations have appropriate impacts, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issues this notice of proposed rulemaking to set expiration dates for its regulations (subject to certain exceptions), unless the Department periodically assesses the regulations to determine if they are subject to the RFA, and if they are, performs a review that satisfies the criteria in the RFA.

We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has received a petition from Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. seeking a determination of nonregulated status for DP23211 maize (corn). The corn is engineered for insect resistance against corn rootworm and contains the gene that codes for the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase protein responsible for tolerance to glufosinate-ammonium herbicides. DP23211 corn also contains the gene that encodes for the phosphomannose isomerase protein, which is used as a selectable marker. We are making the petition available for review and comment to help us identify potential issues and impacts that APHIS may determine should be considered in our evaluation of the petition.

Synthetic biology is a multidisciplinary field of research that involves the design, modification, and creation of biological systems and holds broad promise to advance both basic and applied research in areas ranging from materials science to molecular medicine. However, synthetic nucleic acids and associated technologies may also pose risks if misused. To reduce the risk that individuals with ill intent may exploit the application of nucleic acid synthesis technology to obtain genetic material derived from or encoding Select Agents and Toxins and, as applicable, agents on the Export Administration Regulations' (EAR's) Commerce Control List (CCL), the U.S. Government issued guidance in 2010 providing a framework for screening synthetic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). This document, the Screening Framework Guidance for Providers of Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA (Guidance), sets forth recommended baseline standards for the gene and genome synthesis industry and other providers of synthetic dsDNA products, regarding the screening of orders, so they are filled in compliance with U.S. regulations prohibiting the possession, use, and transfer of specific pathogens and biological toxins. The other goals of the Guidance are to encourage best practices in addressing biosecurity concerns associated with the potential misuse of these products to inflict harm or bypass existing regulatory controls and to minimize any negative impacts on the conduct of research and business operations. Rapid and continued advances in nucleic acid synthesis technologies and synthetic biology applications necessitate periodic reevaluation of associated risks and mitigation measures. We invite public comments on whether and, if so, how the Guidance should be modified to address new and emerging challenges posed by advances in this area. Please submit all comments related to this request for information (RFI) through the web form on the Screening Framework Guidance for Providers of Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA website at https:// www.phe.gov/syndna/update2020.

This final rule of particular applicability (RPA) establishes safety standards for the Texas Central Railroad (TCRR or the railroad) high-speed rail (HSR) system. These standards are not intended for general application in the railroad industry, but apply only to the TCRR system planned for development in the State of Texas. This rule takes a systems approach to safety, and so includes standards that address the aspects of the TCRR HSR system consistent with the regulatory framework for the general system, but in a manner appropriate to TCRR's technology and application, including signal and trainset control, track, rolling stock, operating practices, system qualifications, and maintenance. The TCRR HSR system is planned to operate from Houston to Dallas, on dedicated track, with no grade crossings, at speeds not to exceed 330 km/h (205 mph). The TCRR rolling stock, track, and core systems will replicate the Tokaido Shinkansen HSR system operated by the Central Japan Railway Company (JRC), and will be used exclusively for revenue passenger service.

The Federal Communications Commission is correcting a final that appeared in the Federal Register on October 9, 2020. In the document, the Commission adopts changes to its rules to prepare the 3.45-3.55 GHz band for commercial wireless services. It removes the secondary, non-federal allocations in the 3.3-3.55 GHz band for radiolocation services and the amateur radio service. These services will continue in alternate spectrum; radiolocation operations will be moved to the 2.9-3.0 GHz band, already home to similar operations, and amateur licensees will be able to relocate their operations to other frequencies already available for amateur operations. Clearing this band of secondary services will allow the Commission to auction the 3.45-3.55 GHz band for commercial wireless services on a co-primary basis with federal radio navigation and radiolocation operations.

This action finalizes an amendment to the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for the Phosphoric Acid Manufacturing source category. The final amendment is in response to a petition for rulemaking on the mercury emission limit for existing phosphate rock calciners that was finalized on August 19, 2015 ("2015 Rule"). That emission limit was based on the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) floor for existing sources. All six of the existing calciners used to set this MACT floor are located at the PCS Phosphate Company, Inc. ("PCS Phosphate") facility in Aurora, North Carolina ("PCS Aurora"). PCS Phosphate asserted that data received since the rule's promulgation indicate that the MACT floor did not accurately reflect the average emission limitation achieved by the units used to set the standard. Based on these new data, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing a revision of the mercury MACT floor for existing calciners.

This final rule responds to comments received and adopts the provisions of the IFR with some additional amendments: Restricting the authority of the Director regarding the further delegation of certain regulatory authorities, clarifying that the Director interprets relevant regulatory provisions when adjudicating recognition and accreditation ("R&A") cases, and reiterating the independent judgment and discretion by which the Director will consider cases subject to his adjudication.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) provides that the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) may enter into administrative consent orders (Consent Orders) where the Bureau has identified violations of Federal consumer financial law. The Bureau recognizes that there may be exceptional circumstances where it is appropriate to terminate a Consent Order before its original expiration date. To facilitate such early terminations where appropriate, this policy statement sets forth a process by which an entity subject to a Consent Order may apply for early termination and articulates the standards that the Bureau intends to use when evaluating early termination applications.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the Canoe Creek clubshell (Pleurobema athearni), a freshwater mussel species endemic to a single watershed in north-central Alabama, as an endangered or threatened species and to designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the Canoe Creek clubshell as an endangered species under the Act. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the Canoe Creek clubshell under the Act. In total, approximately 58.5 river kilometers (36.3 river miles) in St. Clair and Etowah Counties, Alabama, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. Finally, we announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Canoe Creek clubshell.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or USFWS), have evaluated the classification status of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) entities currently listed in the lower 48 United States and Mexico under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Based on our evaluation, we are removing the gray wolf entities in the lower 48 United States and Mexico, except for the Mexican wolf (C. l. baileyi), that are currently on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. We are taking this action because the best available scientific and commercial data available establish that the gray wolf entities in the lower 48 United States do not meet the definitions of a threatened species or an endangered species under the Act. The effect of this rulemaking action is that C. lupus is not classified as a threatened or endangered species under the Act. This rule does not have any effect on the separate listing of the Mexican wolf subspecies (Canis lupus baileyi) as endangered under the Act. In addition, we announce a 90-day finding on a petition to maintain protections for the gray wolf in the lower 48 United States as endangered or threatened distinct population segments. Based on our review, we find that the petition does not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, we are not initiating status reviews of the petitioned entities in response to the petition.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-02-21, which applies to all Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 2000 airplanes. AD 2020-02-21 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive and airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-02-21, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

[FEDERAL REGISTER PAGE 40-60] 2020-11-02 00:00:00Z | Modification of Registration Requirement for Petitioners Seeking To File Cap-Subject H-1B Petitions
Source: Federal Register

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS or the Department) proposes to amend its regulations governing the process by which U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) selects H-1B registrations for filing of H-1B cap-subject petitions (or H-1B petitions for any year in which the registration requirement will be suspended), by generally first selecting registrations based on the highest Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) prevailing wage level that the proffered wage equals or exceeds for the relevant Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code and area(s) of intended employment. This proposed rule would not affect the order of selection as between the regular cap and the advanced degree exemption. The wage level ranking would occur first for the regular cap selection and then for the advanced degree exemption. Rote ordering of petitions leads to impossible results because petitions are submitted simultaneously. A random lottery system is reasonable, but inconsiderate of Congress's statutory purposes for the H-1B program and its administration. Instead, a registration system that faithfully implements the INA while prioritizing registrations based on wage level within each cap would increase the average and median wage levels of H-1B beneficiaries who would be selected for further processing under the H-1B allocations. Moreover, it would maximize H-1B cap allocations, so that they more likely would go to the best and brightest workers.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directives (AD) 2000-23-26, AD 2018-14-11, and AD 2019-13-04, which apply to ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR72 airplanes. AD 2019-13- 04 requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive maintenance instructions and airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-13-04, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400, - 401, and -402 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of main landing gear (MLG) retractions after striking an obstacle or severe wheel imbalance after a tire failure. This proposed AD would require inspections for correct height of the lock link over-center stop pin and for correct gaps of the left-hand and right-hand MLG downlock proximity sensors, replacement of the shim if necessary, and corrective actions, and installation of a new improved proximity sensor electronic unit (PSEU) with software changes. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This action proposes to modify the Class D airspace at McChord Field (Joint Base Lewis-McChord), Tacoma, WA. After a review of the airspace, the FAA found it necessary to amend the existing airspace for the safety and management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at this airport. This proposal would also remove a reference to the McChord VORTAC from the legal description, update the airport name and city, and amend the geographical coordinates for the airport to match the FAA's database.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing this final rule to postpone the compliance deadlines for implementation of Phase 2 of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Electronic Reporting Rule ("NPDES eRule"). The NPDES eRule requires EPA and states to modernize Clean Water Act (CWA) reporting. This final rule also provides states with additional flexibility to request additional time as needed. Further, this final rule promulgates clarifying changes to the NPDES eRule and eliminates some duplicative or outdated reporting requirements. Taken together, these changes are designed to save the NPDES authorized programs considerable resources, make reporting easier for NPDES-regulated entities, streamline permit renewals, ensure full exchange of NPDES program data between states and EPA, enhance public transparency, improve environmental decision- making, and protect human health and the environment.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is amending its off-road vehicle (ORV) regulations to add a definition for electric bikes (e- bikes) and, where certain criteria are met and an authorized officer expressly determines through a formal decision that e-bikes should be treated the same as non-motorized bicycles, expressly exempt those e- bikes from the definition of ORV. The regulatory change effectuated by this rule has the potential to facilitate increased recreational opportunities for all Americans, especially those with physical limitations, and could encourage additional enjoyment of lands and waters managed by the BLM.

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by Multimedia Holdings Corporation (Multimedia), licensee of KNPX, channel 12, Mesa, Arizona, requesting the substitution of channel 18 for channel 12 at Mesa in the DTV Table of Allotments. The Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of rulemaking petitions by full power television stations requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, and Multimedia asks that the Commission waive the freeze to permit KPNX to change from a VHF to a UHF channel to better serve its over-the-air viewers. Multimedia states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers. While Multimedia acknowledges that VHF reception issues are not universal, it states that since the 2009 digital transition, when it began operating exclusively on digital channel 12, KPNX has received a steady stream of complaints from viewers unable to receive the station's over-the-air signal, despite being able to receive signals from other local stations. Multimedia believes that waiver of the channel substitution freeze would serve the public interest.

The Assistant Regional Administrator for Sustainable Fisheries, Greater Atlantic Region, NMFS, has made a preliminary determination that an application submitted by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute to amend an existing Exempted Fishing Permit contains all of the required information and warrants further consideration. The amended Exempted Fishing Permit would provide one vessel participating in an electronic monitoring program with an exemption to conduct exploratory fishing using cod ends with smaller mesh than otherwise permitted. The Exempted Fishing Permit would test the effect of different codend mesh combinations on the catch of pollock and Gulf of Maine haddock while on trips targeting Acadian redfish. Regulations under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act require publication of this notification to provide interested parties the opportunity to comment on applications for proposed exempted fishing permits.

This action proposes special conditions for the Leonardo S.p.A. (Leonardo) Model A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters. These helicopters as modified by AgustaWestland Philadelphia Corporation (AWPC) will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for helicopters. This design feature is the optional closed circuit refueling receiver (CCRR). The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.

The Coast Guard is proposing to revise an existing moving security zone for the Port of San Juan, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The proposed revision would expand the existing moving security zone to a 200-yard radius around all cruise ships entering, departing, or anchored in the Port of San Juan. While the cruise ships are moored at the Port of San Juan, the security zone would remain at a 50-yard radius around the cruise ships. This action would continue to prohibit persons and vessels from entering, anchoring, mooring or transiting in the security zone, unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port of San Juan or a designated representative. This action is necessary to better meet the safety and security needs of the Port of San Juan. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.

The "Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 (the SUPPORT Act)," which became law on October 24, 2018, amended the Controlled Substances Act to expand the conditions a practitioner must meet to provide medication-assisted treatment and expand the options available for a physician to be considered a qualifying physician. The SUPPORT Act removed the time period for a nurse practitioner or physician assistant to be considered a qualifying other practitioner, and revised the definition of a qualifying practitioner. The SUPPORT Act also allows a pharmacy to deliver prescribed controlled substances to a practitioner's registered location for the purpose of maintenance or detoxification treatment to be administered under certain conditions by a practitioner. The Drug Enforcement Administration amends its regulations to make them consistent with the SUPPORT Act and implement its requirements.

In accordance with the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), this document proposes to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, "Child restraint systems," by updating the standard seat assembly on which child restraint systems (CRSs) are tested to determine their compliance with the standard's dynamic performance requirements. This NPRM proposes other amendments to modernize FMVSS No. 213, including a lessening of restrictions in some of the standard's owner registration and labeling requirements, to give manufacturers more flexibility in communicating with today's parents for the purposes of increasing owner registrations for recall notification purposes and increasing the correct use of CRSs, respectively. NHTSA is also proposing ways to streamline the Agency's use of test dummies to assess restraint performance, including simplifying the standard's compliance tests to make them more reflective of the real-world use of CRSs today. The purpose of these and other proposals is to modernize the seat assembly and other aspects of FMVSS No. 213, to help ensure the continued effectiveness of CRSs in current and future vehicles.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) received a petition from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) to define a new product class under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (EPCA), for standard residential dishwashers with a cycle time for the normal cycle of less than one hour from washing through drying. Based upon its evaluation of the petition and careful consideration of the public comments, DOE granted CEI's petition and proposed a dishwasher product class with a cycle time for the normal cycle of less than one hour. In this final rule, DOE establishes a new product class for standard residential dishwashers with a cycle time for the normal cycle of one hour (60 minutes) or less from washing through drying. DOE's decision to establish the new product class is based on its evaluation of CEI's petition, the comments the Department received in response to the petition and the proposed rule to establish the new product class, as well as additional testing and evaluation conducted by the Department. This rulemaking only sets out the basis for the new product class. DOE intends to determine the specific energy and water consumption limits for the product class in a separate rulemaking.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve revisions to the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Washington on June 2, 2019, through the Washington Department of Ecology. The proposed revision, applicable in Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Spokane Counties, Washington, removes the Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) program, which was previously approved into the SIP for use as a component of the State's plans to address on- road sources in nonattainment areas. The SIP revision also includes a demonstration that the requested revision to the vehicle model year coverage will not interfere with attainment or maintenance of any national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) or with any other applicable requirement of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). The I/M program will be moved from the active portion of the SIP to the contingency portion of the applicable SIP for each area. The EPA evaluated whether this SIP revision would interfere with the requirements of the CAA. The EPA is proposing to determine that Washington's June 2, 2019 SIP revision is consistent with the applicable portions of the CAA.

[FEDERAL REGISTER PAGE 40-60] 2020-10-30 00:00:00Z | Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS
Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/30/2020-23237/revised-cross-state-air-pollution-rule-update-for-the-2008-ozone-naaqs
This proposed action is taken in response to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's (D.C. Circuit) remand of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Update in Wisconsin v. EPA on September 13, 2019. The CSAPR Update finalized Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) for 22 states to address their interstate pollution-transport obligations under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The D.C. Circuit found that the CSAPR Update, which was published on October 26, 2016, as a partial remedy to address upwind states' obligations prior to the 2018 Moderate area attainment date under the 2008 ozone NAAQS, was unlawful to the extent it allowed those states to continue their significant contributions to downwind ozone problems beyond the statutory dates by which downwind states must demonstrate their attainment of the air quality standards. On the same grounds, the D.C. Circuit also vacated the CSAPR Close-Out in New York v. EPA on October 1, 2019. This proposed rule, if finalized, will resolve 21 states' outstanding interstate ozone transport obligations with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking this action under the Clean Air Act section known as the "good neighbor provision." This action proposes to find that for 9 of the 21 states for which the CSAPR Update was found to be only a partial remedy (Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin), their projected nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) emissions in the 2021 ozone season and thereafter do not significantly contribute to a continuing downwind nonattainment and/or maintenance problem, and therefore the states' CSAPR Update FIPs (or the SIPs subsequently approved to replace certain states' CSAPR Update FIPs) fully address their interstate ozone transport obligations with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. This action also proposes to find that for the 12 remaining states (Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia), their projected 2021 ozone season NO<INF>X</INF> emissions significantly contribute to downwind states' nonattainment and/or maintenance problems for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. EPA proposes to issue new or amended FIPs for these 12 states to replace their existing CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Group 2 emissions budgets for electricity generating units (EGUs) with revised budgets via a new CSAPR NO<INF>X</INF> Ozone Season Group 3 Trading Program. EPA is proposing to require implementation of the revised emission budgets beginning with the 2021 ozone season (which runs annually from May 1-September 30). Based on EPA's assessment of remaining air quality issues and additional emission control strategies for EGUs and other emissions sources in other industry sectors (non-EGUs), EPA further proposes that the proposed NO<INF>X</INF> emission reductions fully eliminate these states' significant contributions to downwind air quality problems for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. EPA also proposes in this action an error correction for its June 2018 approval of Kentucky's good neighbor SIP.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, or conditionally approve, all or portions of two state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by California to meet Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the Sacramento Metro ozone nonattainment area. These SIP revisions include the "Sacramento Regional 2008 NAAQS 8-hour Attainment and Reasonable Further Progress Plan" and the Sacramento Metro portion of the "2018 Updates to the California State Implementation Plan." Collectively, the EPA refers to these submittals as the "Sacramento Metro Area Ozone SIP." The Sacramento Metro Area Ozone SIP addresses the CAA nonattainment area requirements for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, such as the requirements for an emissions inventory, an attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures, and contingency measures, and it establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets. The EPA is proposing to approve the Sacramento Metro Area Ozone SIP as meeting all the applicable ozone nonattainment area requirements, except for the contingency measure requirement where the EPA is proposing a conditional approval. Also, the EPA is beginning the adequacy process for the 2023 and 2024 motor vehicle emissions budgets in the Sacramento Metro Area Ozone SIP via this proposed rule.

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by Sander Operating Co. III LLC (Sander), licensee of KGW, requesting the substitution of channel 26 for channel 8 at Portland in the DTV Table of Allotments. The Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of rulemaking petitions by full power television stations requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, and Sander asks that the Commission waive the freeze to permit KGW to change from a VHF to a UHF channel to better serve its over-the-air viewers. Sander states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers. While Sander acknowledges that VHF reception issues are not universal, it states that since the 2009 digital transition, when it began operating exclusively on digital channel 8, KGW has received a steady stream of complaints from viewers unable to receive the station's over-the-air signal, despite being able to receive signals from other local stations. Sander believes that waiver of the channel substitution freeze would serve the public interest.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rockwell Collins, Inc. (Rockwell Collins), GPS-4000S Global Positioning Systems (GPS) installed on airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by an un-annunciated GPS position error, which could cause a misleading localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) glidepath, resulting in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). This proposed AD would require upgrading the GPS-4000S. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA or Department), is adopting a final rule to exempt the Tongass National Forest from the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (2001 Roadless Rule), which prohibits timber harvest and road construction/reconstruction with limited exceptions within designated inventoried roadless areas. In addition, the rule directs an administrative change to the timber suitability of lands deemed unsuitable, solely due to the application of the 2001 Roadless Rule, in the 2016 Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Tongass Forest Plan or Forest Plan), Appendix A. The rule does not authorize any ground-disturbing activities, nor does it increase the overall amount of timber harvested from the Tongass National Forest.

NHTSA is proposing to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208, "Occupant crash protection," to update the child restraint systems (CRSs) listed in Appendix A-1 of the standard. NHTSA uses the CRSs in Appendix A-1 to test the performance of advanced air bag suppression and low risk deployment systems in either suppressing or deploying the air bag in a low-risk manner in the presence of a CRS. The proposed amendments would ensure that the CRSs used by NHTSA to test advanced air bags are representative of the current CRS fleet, and would make it easier for vehicle manufacturers and test laboratories to acquire CRSs for testing purposes.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2000-23-04 R1 and AD 2018-20-14, which apply to certain ATR--GIE Avions de Transport R[eacute]gional Model ATR42-500 airplanes. AD 2000-23-04 R1 and AD 2018-20-14 require revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new and/or more restrictive maintenance requirements and airworthiness limitations. Since the FAA issued AD 2000-23-04 R1 and AD 2018-20-14, the FAA has determined that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which will be incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This action prohibits certain flight operations in the Tehran Flight Information Region (FIR) (OIIX) by all: U.S. air carriers; U.S. commercial operators; persons exercising the privileges of an airman certificate issued by the FAA, except when such persons are operating U.S.-registered aircraft for a foreign air carrier; and operators of U.S.-registered civil aircraft, except when the operator of such aircraft is a foreign air carrier. The FAA finds this action to be necessary to address hazards to persons and aircraft engaged in such flight operations due to heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East, which present an inadvertent risk to U.S. civil aviation operations due to the potential for miscalculation or misidentification. This action incorporates the flight prohibition contained in Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) KICZ A0002/20 into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This action also sets forth the approval process and exemption information for this Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR), consistent with other recently published flight prohibition SFARs.

Since 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has maintained a Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket ("Docket") under section 120(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Section 120(c) requires EPA to establish a Docket that contains certain information reported to EPA by Federal facilities that manage hazardous waste or from which a reportable quantity of hazardous substances has been released. As explained further below, the Docket is used to identify Federal facilities that should be evaluated to determine if they pose a threat to public health or welfare and the environment and to provide a mechanism to make this information available to the public. This notice identifies the Federal facilities not previously listed on the Docket and identifies Federal facilities reported to EPA since the last update on April 29, 2020. In addition to the list of additions to the Docket, this notice includes a section with revisions of the previous Docket list and a section of Federal facilities that are to be deleted from the Docket. Thus, the revisions in this update include eight additions, six deletions, and zero corrections to the Docket since the previous update. At the time of publication of this notice, the new total number of Federal facilities listed on the Docket is 2,380.

NMFS has received a request from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities (ADOT&PF) for the re-issuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of seven species of marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment, incidental to construction associated with the Auke Bay Ferry Terminal Modifications and Improvements Project in Juneau, Alaska. The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The initial IHA was effective from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. ADOT&PF has requested re-issuance with new effective dates of November 1, 2020 through October 31, 2021. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD- 500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report that threaded fuel couplings were incorrectly installed at final assembly and in service. This proposed AD would require repetitive functional tests of the auxiliary power unit (APU) fuel feed line shroud, a general visual inspection of the APU feed line shroud for any loose couplings; and tightening any loose couplings, which would terminate the repetitive functional tests. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

TSA is extending the exemption from Renewal of the Hazardous Materials Endorsement Security Threat Assessment for Certain Individuals that TSA published on July 31, 2020 which was scheduled to expire on October 30, 2020, through December 31, 2020. Under this exemption, states may extend the expiration date of hazardous materials endorsements (HMEs) that expire on or after March 1, 2020, for 180 days, due to restrictions and business closures in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a state grants an extension, the individual with an expired HME must initiate the process of renewing his or her security threat assessment (STA) for the HME no later than 60 days before the end of the state-granted extension. Federal partners, state licensing agencies and related associations report ongoing difficulties in timely renewal of expiring HMEs and asked TSA to consider extending the exemption until the end of calendar year 2020. TSA has determined it is in the public interest to extend the exemption through December 31, 2020, which aligns with similar waivers issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation. TSA may extend this exemption at a future date depending on the status of the COVID-19 crisis.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Piper Aircraft, Inc., (Piper) Models PA-46-350P (Malibu Mirage), PA-46R-350T (Malibu Matrix), and PA-46-500TP (Malibu Meridian) airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a finding of several airplanes with wing assemblies that did not have the proper stall warning heater modification design. Without the proper stall warning heat control modification kit installed, during flights into icing conditions with the landing gear down, ice can form on the stall vane, which may result in failure of the stall warning system. This proposed AD would require identifying and correcting nonconforming stall warning heat control systems. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve, or conditionally approve, all or portions of three state implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of California to meet Clean Air Act (CAA or "the Act") requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or "standards") in the Eastern Kern, California ("Eastern Kern") ozone nonattainment area. The three SIP revisions include the "2017 Ozone Attainment Plan For 2008 Federal 75 ppb 8-Hour Ozone Standard," the Eastern Kern portion of the "2018 Updates to the California State Implementation Plan," and the "Transportation Conformity Budget State Implementation Plan Update for the Eastern Kern 2017 Ozone Attainment Plan." In this action, the EPA refers to these submittals collectively as the "2017 Eastern Kern Ozone SIP." The 2017 Eastern Kern Ozone SIP addresses certain nonattainment area requirements for the 2008 ozone NAAQS, including the requirements for an emissions inventory, attainment demonstration, reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures, contingency measures, among others; and establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets. The EPA is proposing to approve the 2017 Eastern Kern Ozone SIP as meeting all the applicable ozone nonattainment area requirements except for the contingency measure requirement, for which the EPA is proposing conditional approval, and the reasonably available control measures and attainment demonstration requirements, for which the EPA is deferring action at this time. In addition, the EPA is beginning the adequacy process for the updated motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2020 in the 2017 Eastern Kern Ozone SIP through this proposed rulemaking.

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by Multimedia Holdings Corporation (Multimedia), licensee of KARE, channel 11, Minneapolis, Minnesota, requesting the substitution of channel 31 for channel 11 at Minneapolis in the DTV Table of Allotments. The Commission instituted a freeze on the acceptance of rulemaking petitions by full power television stations requesting channel substitutions in May 2011, and Multimedia asks that the Commission waive the freeze to permit KARE to change from a VHF to a UHF channel to better serve its over-the-air viewers. Multimedia states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers. While Multimedia acknowledges that VHF reception issues are not universal, it states that since the 2009 digital transition, when it began operating exclusively on digital channel 11, KARE has received a steady stream of complaints from viewers unable to receive the station's over-the-air signal, despite being able to receive signals from other local stations. Multimedia believes that waiver of the channel substitution freeze would serve the public interest.

The NCUA Board (Board) is amending its regulation governing assessment of an annual operating fee to Federal credit unions (FCUs). First, for purposes of calculating the annual operating fee, the final rule amends the current rule to exclude from total assets any loan an FCU reports under the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) or similar future programs approved for exclusion by the NCUA Board. Second, the final rule deletes from the current regulation references to the Credit Union System Investment Program and the Credit Union Homeowners Affordability Relief Program, both of which no longer exist. Third, the final rule amends the period used for the calculation of an FCU's total assets. Currently, total assets are calculated using the FCU's December 31st Call Report of the preceding year. Under the final rule, total assets will be calculated as the average total assets reported on the FCU's previous four Call Reports available at the time the NCUA Board approves the agency's budget for the upcoming year, adjusted for any excludable programs as determined by the Board. Finally, the final rule makes some minor technical changes.

NMFS issues this final rule to revise the annual reference points, including the overfishing limit (OFL), acceptable biological catch (ABC) and annual catch limit (ACL), for the central subpopulation of northern anchovy in the U.S. exclusive economic zone off the west coast under the Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan. NMFS prepared this rulemaking in response to a September 2020 court decision (Oceana, Inc. v. Ross et al.) that vacated the OFL, ABC, and ACL for the central subpopulation of northern anchovy and ordered NMFS to promulgate a new rule in compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and Administrative Procedure Act. NMFS is implementing an OFL of 119,153 metric tons (mt), an ABC of 29,788 mt, and an ACL of 25,000 mt. If the ACL for this stock is reached or projected to be reached, then fishing will be closed until it reopens at the start of the next fishing season. This rule is intended to conserve and manage the central subpopulation of northern anchovy off the U.S. West Coast.

In April, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) issued a temporary final rule to allocate certain health and medical resources for domestic use, so that these resources may not be exported from the United States without explicit approval by FEMA. The rule covered five types of personal protective equipment (PPE), outlined below. While this rule remains in effect, and subject to certain exemptions stated below, no shipments of such designated materials may leave the United States without explicit approval by FEMA. In August, FEMA modified the types of PPE covered and extended the duration of the temporary rule. Through this action, FEMA again extends and modifies the temporary final rule designating the list of scarce and critical materials that cannot be exported from the United States without explicit approval by FEMA.

This final rule will advance CMS' efforts to support state flexibility to enter into innovative value-based purchasing arrangements (VBPs) with manufacturers, and to provide manufacturers with regulatory support to enter into VBPs with payers, including Medicaid. To ensure that the regulatory framework is sufficient to support such arrangements and to promote transparency, flexibility, and innovation in drug pricing without undue administrative burden, we are finalizing new regulatory policies and clarifying certain already established policies to assist manufacturers and states in participating in VBPs in a manner that is consistent with the law and maintains the integrity of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP). This final rule also revises regulations regarding: Authorized generic sales when manufacturers calculate average manufacturer price (AMP) for the brand name drug; pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) accumulator programs and their impact on AMP and best price when manufacturer- sponsored assistance is not passed through to the patient; state and manufacturer reporting requirements to the MDRP; new Medicaid Drug Utilization Review (DUR) provisions designed to reduce opioid related fraud, misuse and abuse; the definitions of CMS-authorized supplemental rebate agreement, line extension, new formulation, oral solid dosage form, single source drug, multiple source drug, innovator multiple source drug for purposes of the MDRP; payments for prescription drugs under the Medicaid program; and coordination of benefits (COB) and third party liability (TPL) rules related to the special treatment of certain types of care and payment in Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its export and import regulations to maintain the regulatory status quo for nuclear exports to the United Kingdom (U.K.), upon the entry into force of a new civil nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States (U.S.) and the U.K. (the U.S.-U.K. 123 Agreement). The amendment will add the U.K. to the list of countries eligible to receive certain small quantities of special nuclear material under a general license, and to the list of countries whose export license applications do not require Executive Branch or Commission level reviews for certain exports of source material or low-enriched uranium. This amendment is necessary to bring the NRC's regulations into conformity with U.S. Government foreign policy and preserve existing provisions for nuclear exports to the U.K.

The Commission has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by The Curators of the University of Missouri (the University), licensee of KOMU-TV, channel 8, Columbia, Missouri, requesting the substitution of channel 27 for channel 8 at Columbia in the DTV Table of Allotments. The University states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers. The University states that since the end of the DTV transition in 2009, the station regularly receives complaints from viewers who report being able to receive all other signals in the market, including a low power television station operating on a UHF channel, but not KOMU-TV. While KOMU-TV's proposed channel 27 facility would result in a slight reduction of service to existing viewers, the University demonstrates that only 401 people are predicted to live in portions of the loss area, and that all but seven of those persons will continue to be served by at least five full power television stations. The Commission has found that population loss of less than 500 persons is de minimus and the predicted population loss as presented by the University is only 401 persons and virtually all of them will continue to be well-served by five other full power television stations.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, have received a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 from the Kaktovik I[ntilde]upiat Corporation (KIC), for authorization to take by harassment small numbers of polar bears incidental to seismic survey and associated activities scheduled to occur between January 21, 2021, and September 30, 2021. KIC has requested this authorization for incidental take of polar bears that may result from three-dimensional (3D) seismic surveys in the Marsh Creek East Program Area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The project will consist of activities such as over-flights for aerial infrared surveys in January 2021 and February 2021 to look for maternal polar bear dens; staging and mobilization of vehicles and equipment; small crew surveys for hazards, ice integrity, and snow depth assessment; seismic surveys via a sled camp with rubber-tracked vibrator trucks; camp setup and mobilization; aerial activities for crew and supply transport; digital elevation modeling for river-crossing slope analysis; and cleanup activities during the summer of 2021. We estimate that this project may result in the nonlethal incidental take of up to three polar bears. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for take of three polar bears by Level B harassment only. No take by injury or death to polar bears is likely and therefore such take is not included in this proposed authorization.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) is adopting amendments (Final Rule) revising the conditions set forth in the Commission regulation under which a person located outside of the United States (each, a foreign located person) engaged in the activity of a commodity pool operator (CPO) in connection with commodity interest transactions on behalf of persons located outside the United States (collectively, an offshore commodity pool or offshore pool) would qualify for an exemption from CPO registration and regulation with respect to that offshore pool. The Final Rule provides that the exemption under the applicable Commission regulation for foreign located persons acting as a CPO (a non-U.S. CPO) on behalf of offshore commodity pools may be claimed by such non-U.S. CPOs on a pool-by-pool basis. The Commission is also adopting a provision clarifying that a non-U.S. CPO may claim an exemption from registration under the applicable Commission regulation with respect to a qualifying offshore commodity pool, while maintaining another exemption from CPO registration, relying on a CPO exclusion, or even registering as a CPO, with respect to its operation of other commodity pools. Additionally, the Commission is adopting a safe harbor by which a non-U.S. CPO of an offshore pool may rely upon that exemption, if it satisfies several enumerated factors related to its operation of the offshore commodity pool. The Commission is also adopting an amendment permitting U.S. affiliates of a non-U.S. CPO to contribute initial capital to such non- U.S. CPO's offshore pools, without affecting the eligibility of the non-U.S. CPO for an exemption from registration under the applicable Commission regulation. The Commission is also adopting amendments to the applicable Commission regulation originally proposed in 2016 that clarify whether clearing of commodity interest transactions through a registered futures commission merchant (FCM) is required as a condition of the registration exemptions for foreign intermediaries, and whether such exemption is available for foreign intermediaries acting on behalf of international financial institutions.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is seeking comment on a proposed rule that would amend the risk-based deposit insurance assessment system applicable to all large insured depository institutions (IDIs), including highly complex IDIs, to address the temporary deposit insurance assessment effects resulting from certain optional regulatory capital transition provisions relating to the implementation of the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology. The proposal would amend the assessment regulations to remove the double counting of a specified portion of the CECL transitional amount or the modified CECL transition amount, as applicable (collectively, the CECL transitional amounts), in certain financial measures that are calculated using the sum of Tier 1 capital and reserves and that are used to determine assessment rates for large and highly complex IDIs. The proposal also would adjust the calculation of the loss severity measure to remove the double counting of a specified portion of the CECL transitional amounts for a large or highly complex IDI. This proposal would not affect regulatory capital or the regulatory capital relief provided in the form of transition provisions that allow banking organizations to phase in the effects of CECL on their regulatory capital ratios.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/04/2020-26194/housing-counseling-program-revision-of-the-certification-timeline
This final rule follows HUD's interim final rule (the interim rule) published on August 5, 2020. The interim rule extended the deadline by which participating agencies and counselors must comply with certification requirements in HUD's Housing Counseling Program from August 1, 2020 to August 1, 2021. The reason for the extension is that due to the COVID-19 national emergency, a large number of housing counselors would have been unable to get certified by the end of the grace period, resulting in a loss of Federal funding for some HUD- approved housing counseling agencies and loss of the ability to provide counseling that is required or provided in numerous HUD programs. HUD considered public comment on the interim rule. This rule makes the interim rule a final rule, without change.

In this final rule, the Postal Service withdraws all authorizations to distribute (decertifies) Postage Evidencing Systems (PES) that are not producing compliant Intelligent Mail Indicia (IMI) on June 30, 2024. IMI compliant PES are defined in the IMI Performance Criteria (IMI-PC) and produce only IMI-Minimum (IMI-MIN), IMI-Standard (IMI-STD), and IMI-Maximum (IMI-MAX) indicia constructs (as stated in the IMI-PC). All PES that are not IMI-PC compliant, also referenced as Phase VI-IBI and Phase VII-PC Postage (collectively Phase VI and Phase VII PES), will become decertified Postage Evidencing Systems on June 30, 2024. The decertified Postage Evidencing Systems must be withdrawn from service by December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the decertified PES must be marked inactive in the USPS PES management systems, including in the National Meter Accounting and Tracking System (NMATS). Postage indicia printed by Decertified PES will no longer be considered valid postage for use or refunds after June 30, 2025.

Source: Federal Register

The NCUA Board (Board) seeks public comment on a proposed rule to amend its regulations by removing the prohibition on the capitalization of interest in connection with loan workouts and modifications. The Board has determined that the current prohibition on authorizing additional advances to finance unpaid interest may be overly burdensome and, in some cases, hamper a federally insured credit union's (FICU's) good-faith efforts to engage in loan workouts with borrowers facing difficulty because of the economic disruption that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused. Advancing interest may avert the need for alternative actions that would be more harmful to borrowers. The proposed rule would establish documentation requirements to help ensure that the addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of a mortgage loan does not hinder the borrower's ability to become current on the loan. The proposed change would apply to workouts of all types of member loans, including commercial and business loans. The Board has also taken this opportunity to make several technical changes to the Appendix to improve its clarity and update certain references. For the convenience of readers, the Board is republishing the Appendix in its entirety so that the changes may be viewed in the context of the full document.

On September 17, 2019, HUD published a proposed rule implementing sections 102, 103 and 104 of the Housing Opportunity through Modernization Act (HOTMA) of 2016. The comment period for the proposed rule closed on November 18, 2019. Among other things, Sec. 960.507 of the rule proposed adding a section addressing the treatment of families in public housing whose family income exceeds the new limit in HOTMA. Before finalizing the rule, HUD seeks additional public comment on the implementation of the public housing income limit, specifically public housing agencies' (PHAs') discretion in addressing over-income families. This notice therefore re-opens the public comment period on the HOTMA proposed rule for an additional 30 days solely to seek comment on these specific issues. HUD is not soliciting comment on any other issues related to HUD's September 17, 2019, proposed rule.

This action updates many of EPA's existing gasoline, diesel, and other fuel quality programs to improve overall compliance assurance and maintain environmental performance, while reducing compliance costs for industry and EPA. EPA is streamlining existing fuel quality regulations by removing expired provisions, eliminating redundant compliance provisions (e.g., duplicative registration requirements that are required by every EPA fuels program), removing unnecessary and out- of-date requirements, and replacing them with a single set of provisions and definitions that applies to all gasoline, diesel, and other fuel quality programs. This action does not change the stringency of the existing fuel quality standards.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve through parallel processing a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of California to address Clean Air Act (CAA or "Act") requirements for the 2012 annual fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or "standard") in the Plumas County Moderate PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area ("Portola nonattainment area"). The submitted SIP revision is the State's "Proposed Portola PM<INF>2.5</INF> Plan Contingency Measure SIP Submittal" ("Proposed PM<INF>2.5</INF> Plan Revision"), which includes a revised City of Portola ordinance regulating PM<INF>2.5</INF> emission sources and the State's demonstration that this submission meets the Moderate area contingency measure requirement for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS in the Portola nonattainment area. The EPA is also proposing to approve the contingency measure element of the Moderate area attainment plan for the Portola nonattainment area, as revised and supplemented by the Proposed PM<INF>2.5</INF> Plan Revision. Because the EPA is proceeding by parallel processing, the agency is proposing, in the alternative, to disapprove the contingency measure element of the Moderate area attainment plan if the State does not submit the final, adopted PM<INF>2.5</INF> Plan Revision in substantially the same form before we take final action.

This final rule modifies Federal permit conditions and imposes participation requirements for certain federally permitted vessels when fishing for Pacific cod in state waters adjacent to the exclusive economic zone of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands during the State of Alaska's parallel Pacific cod fishery. This action is necessary to enhance Federal conservation, management, and catch accounting measures previously adopted by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) regarding license limitation, sector allocations, and catch reporting.

NMFS proposes 2021 and 2022 harvest specifications, apportionments, and prohibited species catch allowances for the groundfish fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. This action is necessary to establish harvest limits for groundfish during the 2021 and 2022 fishing years and to accomplish the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (FMP). The 2021 harvest specifications supersede those previously set in the final 2020 and 2021 harvest specifications, and the 2022 harvest specifications will be superseded in early 2022 when the final 2022 and 2023 harvest specifications are published. The intended effect of this action is to conserve and manage the groundfish resources in the BSAI in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).

NMFS proposes 2021 and 2022 harvest specifications, apportionments, and Pacific halibut prohibited species catch limits for the groundfish fishery of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to establish harvest limits for groundfish during the 2021 and 2022 fishing years and to accomplish the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska. The 2021 harvest specifications supersede those previously set in the final 2020 and 2021 harvest specifications, and the 2022 harvest specifications will be superseded in early 2022 when the final 2022 and 2023 harvest specifications are published. The intended effect of this action is to conserve and manage the groundfish resources in the GOA in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).

This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of Adipic acid when used as an inert ingredient in antimicrobial pesticide formulations applied to food- contact surfaces in public eating places, dairy-processing equipment, and food-processing equipment and utensils at an end-use concentration not to exceed 100 parts per million (ppm). Ecolab, Inc. submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requesting establishment of an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for adipic acid. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of adipic acid when used in accordance with this exemption.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a high-elevation tree species found across western North America, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species. We also propose a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act that is necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of the species. We have determined that designation of critical habitat for the whitebark pine is not prudent at this time.

Although introduction of live FMD virus into the United States is prohibited by law, the petition states that this leaderless strain should not be considered live FMD virus as it is non-infectious, non-transmissible, and incapable of causing FMD. We are taking this action in order to provide commenters with additional scientific information supporting our determination that the leaderless virus strain from which Zoetis, Inc. intends to produce FMD vaccine in the United States poses no risk of causing FMD infection in animals. This action gives interested persons the opportunity to review the additional information and submit comments.

On September 28, 2020, the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) published a final rule that repealed the regulatory requirement that production credit associations (PCAs) amortize their loans in 15 years or less, while requiring all Farm Credit System (FCS or System) associations to address amortization through their credit underwriting standards and internal controls. In that publication, FCA inadvertently omitted a statement that the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs determined that the final rule is not a major rule under the applicable provisions of the Congressional Review Act. This document corrects that error.

FDIC is seeking a new OMB Control Number for this version of the survey. The 2021 Household Survey is scheduled to be conducted in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau as a supplement to its June 2021 Current Population Survey (CPS). The survey collects information on U.S. households' use of bank accounts, other transaction accounts including prepaid cards and online payment services, nonbank financial transaction services, and bank and nonbank credit. The results of these biennial surveys will be published in the FDIC's How America Banks reports which help inform policymakers, bankers, and researchers about how households use, or don't use, the banking system.

The final regulations also clarify that the definition of "unrelated trade or business" applies to individual retirement accounts. Additionally, the final regulations provide that inclusions of "subpart F income" and "global intangible low-taxed income" are treated in the same manner as dividends for purposes of determining unrelated business taxable income.

EPA (or the Agency) is finalizing its proposed decisions to not impose financial responsibility requirements under section 108(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) for facilities in three industry sectors: The electric power generation, transmission, and distribution industry, pursuant to EPA's proposal of July 29, 2019; the petroleum and coal products manufacturing industry, pursuant to EPA's proposal of December 23, 2019; and the chemical manufacturing industry, pursuant to EPA's proposal of February 21, 2020. Today's final rulemakings are based on the individual administrative records for each of the three proposed rulemakings, supported by additional analysis conducted in consideration of comments received in the public comment period for each proposed rule. In particular, after examining the existing environmental protections and regulations in place today and analyzing the Superfund program's experience cleaning up sites in each industry, the Agency concluded that facilities in these three industries operating under a modern regulatory framework do not present a level of risk that warrants financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA section 108(b). Today's final rulemakings are based on the record for these rulemakings, and do not affect EPA's authority to take a response or enforcement action under CERCLA with respect to any particular facility or industry, and do not affect the Agency's authorities that may apply to particular facilities under other environmental statutes. This combined final rulemaking comprises the Agency's final actions on each of the three proposed rules.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the peppered chub (Macrhybopsis tetranema) as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The peppered chub is a freshwater fish historically found in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, and is now extirpated in all but approximately 6 percent of its historical range. After review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the peppered chub is warranted due to a dramatic reduction in the species' range (a loss of all but one population) and the low resiliency level of the remaining population. The primary stressors affecting the peppered chub are habitat fragmentation and degradation resulting from several sources, as discussed in this document and its supporting materials. Because we have found the species is at risk of extinction, we propose to list the peppered chub as an endangered species under the Act. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the peppered chub under the Act. The proposed critical habitat designation includes approximately 1,068 river miles (1,719 river kilometers) in four units in Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. We announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed critical habitat designation.

Additionally, CBP included a summary of the CBP Trusted Traveler Programs Fee Study (Fee Study) in the NPRM and stated that the full Fee Study was included in the docket of the rulemaking. CBP inadvertently failed to post the Fee Study on the docket when the NPRM was published.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (EPCA), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products, including direct heating equipment (DHE). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to periodically determine whether more- stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. After carefully considering the available market and technical information for these products, DOE has tentatively concluded in this document that more-stringent standards for DHE would not save a significant amount of energy. Further, depending on the product class, more-stringent standards for DHE would not be technologically feasible or economically justified. As such, DOE has tentatively determined that amended energy conservation standards are not needed. DOE requests comment on this proposed determination, as well as the associated analyses and results.

The Minneapolis Grain Exchange, Inc.

After careful consideration, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or "Commission") believes that the Product has the potential to offer competition with the only comparable incumbent volatility product in the market, and is therefore conditionally exempting the Product from the definition of "security future" for all purposes other than as follows: First, the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions under the Exchange Act will continue to apply; second, MGEX will continue to be subject to the requirement to register with the Commission as a national securities exchange (which may be done pursuant to a notice filing) and comply with related amendment and supplemental filing requirements; and third, MGEX will continue to be required, in its capacity as a national securities exchange, to make available to the Commission (or its representatives) books and records relating to transactions in the Product, upon request, and to make itself available to inspection and examination by the Commission (or its representatives), upon request. However, because registration as a notice-registered national securities exchange is intended only as a means to facilitate the Commission's ability to exercise its books and records and examination authority over the Product, MGEX will be exempt from compliance with all other requirements applicable to national securities exchanges. Taken together, these actions will allow the Product to trade as a futures contract on MGEX, a designated contract market ("DCM") and derivatives clearing organization ("DCO") that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), consistent with the terms and conditions set forth below.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), have received an application from TG High Prairie, LLC (applicant) for an incidental take permit (ITP) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), for its High Prairie Wind Energy Facility. If approved, the ITP would be for a 6-year period and would authorize the incidental take of covered species, including the endangered Indiana bat, threatened northern long-eared bat, and the little brown bat, currently under discretionary review. While the ITP is for 6 years, the wind energy project is scheduled to be operational for thirty years and intensive monitoring conducted during this permit term will inform the need for future avoidance or a new long-term ITP that will comply with a new NEPA analysis and habitat conservation plan (HCP). The applicant has prepared a HCP that describes the actions and measures that the applicant would implement to avoid, minimize, and mitigate incidental take of the covered species for the first 6 years. We also announce the availability of a draft environmental assessment, which has been prepared in response to the permit application in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). We request public comment on the application, which includes the applicant's proposed HCP, the Service's draft environmental assessment, prepared pursuant to NEPA and associated documents. We provide this notice to seek review and comment from the public and Federal, Tribal, State and local governments.

In this document, the Commission expands its video description requirements by phasing them in for an additional 10 designated market areas (DMAs) each year for the next four years. This action is based on a finding that the costs of expanding the video description regulations to DMAs 61 through 100 are reasonable for program owners, providers, and distributors. In addition, the Commission modernizes the terminology in its rules to use the more common and widely understood term "audio description" rather than "video description." Finally, the Commission adopts its proposal to delete from the rules outdated references to compliance deadlines that have passed.

The Seventh FNPRM proposes to make permanent the current freeze on new applications and grandfather all current public safety licensees. It also proposes to allow states without a statewide license to obtain such a license and seeks comment on the creation of a voluntary state band manager to coordinate operations in the band. Lastly, it seeks comment on additional ways to implement and facilitate robust use of the band, including steps to address expanded access in states that divert 911 fees, the use of dynamic spectrum sharing, and ways to encourage collaboration across jurisdictions.

Wheeler, et al., in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (1:17-CV-02034). The Plaintiff filed its original case on October 3, 2017, alleging that EPA violated Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by failing to consult on the effects to listed species of certain pesticide product registrations containing one of three pesticide active ingredients--acetamiprid (Claim One), dinotefuran (Claim Two), and imidacloprid (Claim Three). EPA and Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) are proposing to reach a settlement in the form of a Partial Stipulated Settlement Agreement. Defendant-Intervenor indicated that it takes no position on this proposed partial agreement. Among other provisions, the proposed partial stipulated settlement agreement between EPA and NRDC calls for EPA to complete an endangered species effects determination with respect to imidacloprid (Claim Three) by June 30, 2022. And, as appropriate, EPA will initiate consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service and/or the Fish and Wildlife Service (Services).

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Family Assistance (OFA), has had administrative responsibility for federal funding of programs that strengthen families through healthy marriage and relationship education and responsible fatherhood programming since 2006 through the Healthy Marriage (HM) and Responsible Fatherhood (RF) Grant Programs. ACF required the 2015 cohort of HMRF grantees--which received 5-year grants in September 2015--to collect and report performance measures about program operations, services, and clients served (OMB #0970-0460). A performance measures data collection system called nFORM (Information, Family Outcomes, Reporting, and Management) was implemented with the 2015 cohort to improve the efficiency of data collection and reporting and the quality of data. This system allows for streamlined and standardized submission of grantee performance data through regular progress reports and supports grantee-led and federal research projects. ACF will continue performance measure and other data collection activities for the HMRF grant program with a new cohort of grantees who received 5-year awards in September 2020. ACF is requesting comment on a new data collection to support these activities with the 2020 HMRF grantee cohort. ACF has made changes to the previous cohort's data collection instruments and performance reports for use in the new cohort. This new grantee cohort is expected to begin collecting performance measure data and reporting to ACF in April 2021.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) debarring Tuan Anh Tran for a period of 5 years from importing or offering for import any drug into the United States. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Tran engaged in a pattern of importing or offering for import misbranded drugs (i.e., in an amount, frequency, or dosage that is inconsistent with his personal or household use) that are not designated in an authorized electronic data interchange system as products regulated by FDA. Mr. Tran was given notice of the proposed debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of September 14, 2020 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Tran had not responded. Mr. Trans's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.

In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator's October 16, 2017, Directive Promoting Transparency and Public Participation in Consent Decrees and Settlement Agreements, notice is hereby given of a proposed stipulated order of partial dismissal to address several claims in a lawsuit filed by Northwest Environmental Advocates in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho. On September 24, 2013 the Northwest Environmental Advocates and the Idaho Conservation League (collectively "Plaintiffs") filed an amended complaint bringing claims against the EPA alleging, among other things, that it failed to perform duties mandated by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to consult with the Fish & Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service (collectively "the Services") regarding its actions under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and that EPA failed to complete various mandatory duties under the CWA with respect to various new and revised water quality standards adopted by the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. EPA seeks public input on the proposed stipulated order of partial dismissal prior to its final decision-making to settle the litigation.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) Arriel 2D and Arriel 2E model turboshaft engines. This proposed AD was prompted by the manufacturer revising the maintenance and overhaul manuals to introduce new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations and maintenance tasks. This proposed AD would require the replacement of certain critical parts before reaching their published in-service life limits, performing scheduled maintenance tasks before reaching their published periodicity, and performing unscheduled maintenance tasks when the engine meets certain conditions. As a terminating action, this proposed AD would require operators to revise the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of their existing approved aircraft maintenance program (AMP) by incorporating the revised airworthiness limitations and maintenance tasks. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring John Kapoor from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that John Kapoor was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. John Kapoor was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. Mr. Kapoor, through counsel, submitted a letter to FDA, which commented on some of the factual circumstances surrounding the case. In the letter, he also stated that he did not intend to request a hearing nor, however, would he acquiesce to debarment. As of August 26, 2020 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Kapoor has not requested a hearing. His failure to request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this action.

Currently, FHWA is responsible for oversight of State highway agencies' EEO programs, which include collection and analysis of internal employment data, development of an internal affirmative action hiring plan, and contractor compliance reporting. These regulations overlap with, and are duplicative of, other Federal requirements enforced by other Federal agencies.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and seeking public comment on an updated draft guidance document entitled "Guidance for Plant Regulator Products and Claims, including Plant Biostimulants," which was originally issued for public review and comment in March 2019. Guidance documents are issued by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to inform pesticide registrants and other interested persons about important policies, procedures, and registration related decisions, and serve to provide guidance to pesticide registrants and OPP personnel. EPA updated the original draft guidance document in response to the public comments received on the original draft guidance document. EPA is seeking an additional round of public comment on this updated draft guidance document, which is intended to provide guidance on identifying product claims that are considered to be plant regulator claims by the Agency, thereby subjecting the products to regulation as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Examples are provided of both claims that are considered plant regulator claims and claims that are not considered plant regulator claims. This draft guidance document also contains a narrative discussion regarding current and previously registered plant regulator active ingredients and their modes of action. This draft guidance does not address or attempt to provide a regulatory definition for "plant biostimulant" or for "nutritional chemical" or to change any existing regulatory definitions. After considering the comments received on this draft updated guidance, EPA intends to issue a final guidance document.

Discounts for prescription pharmaceutical products are central to this final rule, in which the Department of Health and Human Services (Department or HHS) amends the safe harbor regulation concerning discounts. Amending this regulation changes the definition of certain conduct that is protected from liability under the Federal anti-kickback statute of the Social Security Act (the Act). New regulatory text in the amendment revises the discount safe harbor. By excluding from the definition of a discount eligible for safe harbor protection certain reductions in price or other remuneration from a manufacturer of prescription pharmaceutical products to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D or pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) under contract with them, the Department modifies the existing discount safe harbor in particular contexts. Existing safe harbors otherwise remain unchanged. Safe harbors are also created for two additional types of arrangements. The first protects certain point-of-sale reductions in price on prescription pharmaceutical products, and the second protects certain PBM service fees.

NMFS implements an accountability measure for the commercial sector of gray triggerfish in the South Atlantic exclusive economic zone (EEZ). NMFS projects commercial landings of gray triggerfish will reach the commercial annual catch limit (ACL) for the July through December season by November 29, 2020. Therefore, NMFS is closing the commercial sector for gray triggerfish in the South Atlantic EEZ on November 29, 2020. This closure is necessary to protect the gray triggerfish resource.

Current regulations stipulate that these facilities send the Coast Guard two copies of their Operations Manual, their Emergency Manual, if applicable, and any amendments to the manuals. This proposed rule would allow facility operators to submit one electronic or printed copy of the manuals and amendments to the manuals. This proposed rule would also require these facilities to maintain either an electronic or a printed copy of each required manual in the marine transfer area of the facility during transfer operations.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry (GFI) #242 entitled "In-Use Stability Studies and Associated Labeling Statements for Multiple-Dose Injectable Animal Drug Products." The purpose of in-use stability testing is to establish a period of time during which a multiple-dose drug product may be used while retaining acceptable quality specifications once the container is opened (e.g., after a container has been needle-punctured). This guidance reflects the Agency's current thinking on how to formulate in-use statements, as well as how to design and carry out in-use stability studies to support these in-use statements, for multiple-dose injectable drug products intended for use in animals. This current thinking pertains to both generic drug products and pioneer drug products regardless of whether the pioneer reference listed new animal drug (RLNAD) currently has an in-use statement on the labeling.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulations governing Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and Family Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) to allow a SGLI- covered member (member) who marries another SGLI-eligible member (member spouse) after January 1, 2013, or a member whose spouse becomes a member spouse after January 1, 2013, to receive FSGLI coverage on a member spouse at the maximum statutory amount or a lesser amount, or to increase existing FSGLI coverage on a member spouse. A member married to a member may elect or increase FSGLI coverage for a member spouse, without a requirement to show good health, within 240 days of: The member's marriage to another member, the member's spouse entering service, or the member's spouse separating from service. If a member does not elect or increase FSGLI coverage within this 240-day "no health" period, then the member can still receive or increase FSGLI coverage by applying for such coverage and submitting proof of the member spouse's good health. The final rulemaking also states that FSGLI coverage that is in force at the time a spouse or child enters service will continue and the member is not required to elect or reapply for such coverage. Additionally, VA is making a technical amendment to the amendatory language.

Current FAST-41 sectors include renewable and conventional energy production, electricity transmission, surface transportation, aviation, ports and waterways, water resource projects, broadband, pipelines, and manufacturing. The addition of mining as a FAST-41 sector would allow a qualified mining infrastructure project to become a FAST-41 covered project. FAST-41 coverage does not predetermine the outcome of any Federal decision making process, but is intended to improve the timeliness, predictability, and transparency of the Federal environmental review and authorization processes for covered infrastructure projects.

SBA proposes to increase size standards for 70 industries in those sectors, including 14 industries in NAICS Sector 61 (Education Services), 18 industries in Sector 62 (Health Care and Social Assistance), 11 industries in Sector 71 (Arts, Entertainment and Recreation), 4 industries in Sector 72 (Accommodation and Food Services), and 23 industries in Sector 81 (Other Services). SBA's proposed revisions rely on its recently revised "Size Standards Methodology" (Methodology). SBA seeks comments on its proposed changes to size standards in the above sectors, and the data sources it evaluated to develop the proposed size standards.

TK Holdings Inc. ("Takata") has filed defect information reports (DIRs), in which it determined that a defect exists in certain passenger-side frontal air bag inflators that it manufactured, including passenger-side inflators that it supplied to General Motors, LLC (GM) for use in certain GMT900 vehicles. GM petitioned NHTSA for a decision that, because of differences in inflator design and vehicle integration, the equipment defect determined to exist by Takata is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety in GM's GMT900 vehicles, and that GM should therefore be relieved of its notification and remedy obligations under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 and its applicable regulations. After reviewing GM's consolidated petition, supporting materials, and public comments, NHTSA has concluded that GM has not met its burden of establishing that the defect is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety, and denies the petition.

We find that the petition and information readily available in our files does not present new information or analyses that had not been previously considered and therefore does not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. Nevertheless, we note that we are separately initiating a five-year review of the status of the Arctic ringed seal pursuant to section 4(c)(2) of the ESA, including whether the best scientific and commercial data available indicate delisting is warranted.

The EPA finds that the NO<INF>X</INF> BART Alternative for Hunter and Huntington achieves greater reasonable progress toward natural visibility conditions than BART, in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the EPA's Regional Haze Rule. In conjunction with this approval, we are withdrawing the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) that addresses NO<INF>X</INF> BART for the Hunter and Huntington power plants that EPA promulgated in 2016. The EPA is also approving Utah's December 3, 2019 SIP supplement that requires reporting of all deviations from compliance with the applicable requirements under particulate matter (PM) BART and the NO<INF>X</INF> BART Alternative, including the emission limits for Hunter and Huntington. The EPA is taking these actions pursuant to sections 110 and 169A of the CAA.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is issuing final regulations to enable certain Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans to apply for land allotments under Section 1119 of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of March 12, 2019 (Dingell Act). The Dingell Act requires the BLM to issue regulations to implement the Act's land allotment provisions. This action will enable certain Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans to apply for an allotment who, because of their military service, were not able to do so during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In this document, the Commission takes definitive steps to address the arbitrage and fraud that have increasingly undermined the system of intercarrier compensation that currently underpins toll free calling. Those steps include transitioning 8YY end office originating charges to bill-and-keep over approximately three years and creating a single charge for 8YY tandem switching and transport services and capping it at a lower, uniform rate. The order caps rates for the database queries necessary to route toll free calls, reduces them to a national uniform rate over approximately three years, and limits such database query charges to one per call. Finally, the Commission allows carriers to use existing mechanisms to recover lost revenue. The measures will reduce the incentives for carriers to engage in 8YY access arbitrage and lower the costs of 8YY services overall.

NMFS issues a final rule under the authority of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) to approve and implement rebuilding plans recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) for two overfished salmon stocks: Klamath River fall-run Chinook salmon (KRFC) and Sacramento River fall-run Chinook salmon (SRFC). NMFS determined in 2018 that these stocks were overfished under the MSA, due to spawning escapement falling below the required level for the three-year period 2015-2017. The MSA requires overfished stocks to be rebuilt, generally within 10 years.

This notice describes the program rules, waivers, and alternative requirements that apply to $25,000,000 for activities authorized under the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, entitled Pilot Program to Help Individuals in Recovery From a Substance Use Disorder Become Stably Housed, herein referred to as the Recovery Housing Program, or RHP. This pilot program authorizes assistance to grantees (states and the District of Columbia) to provide stable, temporary housing to individuals in recovery from a substance use disorder. The assistance is limited, per individual, to a period of not more than 2 years or until the individual secures permanent housing, whichever is earlier. The funds for fiscal year 2020 allocations described in this notice were made available by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, which was signed by President Trump on December 20, 2019. The SUPPORT Act requires funds appropriated or made available for the RHP be treated as community development block grant (CDBG) funds under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act), unless otherwise provided or modified by waivers and alternative requirements. The SUPPORT Act also authorizes the Secretary to waive or specify alternative requirements to any provision of the HCD Act, except for requirements related to fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, the environment, and requirements that activities benefit persons of low- and moderate-income. This notice describes applicable waivers and alternative requirements to the CDBG program requirements which have been found to be necessary to expedite or facilitate the use of RHP funds.

In approximately 4 to 7 months, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will publish in the Federal Register a notice of intended operation, which will allow the public to submit requests for hearing regarding the licensee's conformance with the acceptance criteria in the combined license (COL) for Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 4. These acceptance criteria are part of the inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC) included in the COL. If a member of the public believes access to Safeguards Information (SGI) is necessary to file a hearing request, then members of the public must satisfy several standards, including a determination by the NRC that they are "trustworthy and reliable." Because the background checks used to support trustworthiness and reliability determinations take some time to complete, the NRC is providing this "pre-clearance" process, by which members of the public may initiate background checks to be completed by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) well before the hearing process begins.

Under an Executive Order that directs federal agencies to address the economic emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic by rescinding, modifying, waiving, or providing exemptions from regulations and other requirements that may inhibit economic recovery, consistent with applicable law and with protection of the public health and safety, with national and homeland security, and with budgetary priorities and operational feasibility. The Order directs agencies to "identify regulatory standards that may inhibit economic recovery" and to take appropriate action such as rescission or suspension of regulations, including by use of good cause or emergency authorities where appropriate. Agencies have likewise been called on to assess the various temporary deregulatory actions they have taken to fight COVID- 19 and its impact on our economy to determine which temporary regulatory actions should be made permanent. The Order directs agencies to assist businesses and other entities in complying with the law through prompt issuance of pre-enforcement rulings and to formulate policies of enforcement discretion that recognize such entities' efforts to comply with the law.

This proposed rule would codify the Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) procedures regarding time credits as authorized by the First Step Act of 2018 (FSA), hereinafter referred to as "FSA Time Credits." The FSA provides that eligible inmates may earn FSA Time Credits towards pre- release custody or early transfer to supervised release for successfully completing approved Evidence-Based Recidivism Reduction programs or Productive Activities that are assigned to the inmate based on the inmate's risk and needs assessment. Eligible inmates include those individuals who are sentenced under the U.S. Code and in the custody of the Bureau. However, as required by the FSA, an inmate cannot earn FSA Time Credits if he or she is serving a sentence for a disqualifying offense or has a disqualifying prior conviction. However, these inmates can still earn other benefits, as authorized by the Bureau, for successfully completing recidivism reduction programming.

The Rural Business-Cooperative Service (the Agency) Notice of Solicitation of Applications (NOSA) is being issued prior to passage of a final appropriations act to allow potential applicants time to submit applications for financial assistance under Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) for Federal Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 and give the Agency time to process applications within the current FY. This NOSA is being issued prior to enactment of full year appropriation for FY 2021. The Agency anticipates publishing a final rule for REAP later this year which will conform in part to the OneRD Guaranteed loan provisions published in the Federal Register on July 14, 2020 and will outline provisions as prescribed by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334), (2018 Farm Bill). It is the Agency's intention that the final REAP rule will codify REAP scoring criteria as outlined in this NOSA. All REAP applications competing for FY 2021 funding will be scored according to the scoring criteria listed in this NOSA. Applicants who have already filed REAP applications for FY 2021 will be allowed to provide additional information necessary for application scoring, and the modification will not be treated as a new application nor will it alter the submission date of record as noted in 4280.110(e). The Agency will publish the amount of funding received in any continuing resolution or the final appropriations act on its website at https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/notices-solicitation- applications-nosas. Expenses incurred in developing applications will be at the applicant's risk. The REAP program has two types of funding assistance: (1) Renewable Energy Systems, Energy Efficiency Improvements and Energy Efficient Equipment and Systems Assistance and (2) Energy Audit and Renewable Energy Development Assistance Grants. The Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvement Assistance provides grants and guaranteed loans to agricultural producers and rural small businesses to purchase and install renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency improvements to their operations. The Energy Efficient Equipment and Systems Assistance provisions were prescribed by the 2018 Farm Bill and provide guaranteed loans only to agricultural producers to purchase and install energy efficient equipment and systems for agricultural production and processing. Eligible renewable energy systems for REAP provide energy from: Wind, solar, renewable biomass (including anaerobic digesters and biogas), small hydro-electric, ocean, geothermal, or hydrogen derived from these renewable resources. Components and ancillary infrastructure of such renewable energy systems, such as a storage system, are also eligible. The Energy Audit and Renewable Energy Development Assistance Grant is available to a unit of State, Tribal, or local government; instrumentality of a State, Tribal, or local government; institution of higher education; rural electric cooperative; a public power entity; or a council, as defined in 16 U.S.C. 3451. The recipient of grant funds (grantee) will establish a program to assist agricultural producers and rural small businesses with evaluating the energy efficiency and the potential to incorporate renewable energy technologies into their operations.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is granting an exemption to certain member firms designated by NZX Limited (NZX) from the application of certain of the Commission's foreign futures and option regulations based upon substituted compliance with certain comparable regulatory and self-regulatory requirements of a foreign regulatory authority consistent with conditions specified by the Commission, as set forth herein. This Order is issued pursuant to Commission regulation 30.10, which permits persons to file a petition with the Commission for exemption from the application of certain of the regulations set forth in part 30 and authorizes the Commission to grant such an exemption if such action would not be otherwise contrary to the public interest or to the purposes of the provision from which exemption is sought. The Commission notes that this Order does not pertain to any transaction in swaps, as defined in Section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act (Act).

NMFS received a request from the United States Navy (Navy) on October 14, 2020, for a modification to the incidental harassment authorization (IHA) that was issued on July 3, 2019 due to an elevated harbor seal take rate that was unanticipated. A small group of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) repeatedly entered into and remained within the Level A harassment zone, resulting in a take rate that was projected to exceed the authorized limit for this species. The Navy felt that without an increase in authorized take of harbor seal they would be forced to repeatedly shut down whenever animals entered into specified Level A harassment zones, which would impede their ability to get the work done in the time needed. Therefore, NMFS is proposing to modify the IHA to increase authorized take by Level A harassment of harbor seal. NMFS is also proposing to revise the shutdown mitigation provisions for harbor seals in the modified IHA. The monitoring and reporting measures remain the same as prescribed in the initial IHA and no additional take was requested for other species. NMFS will consider public comments on the requested modification prior to making any final decision and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of the final Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) risk evaluation of Trichloroethylene (TCE). The purpose of conducting risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, including an unreasonable risk to a relevant potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors. EPA has determined that specific conditions of use of TCE present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. For those conditions of use for which EPA has found an unreasonable risk, EPA must take regulatory action to address that unreasonable risk through risk management measures enumerated in TSCA. EPA has also determined that specific conditions of use do not present unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. For those conditions of use for which EPA has found no unreasonable risk to health or the environment, the Agency's determination is a final Agency action and is issued via order in the risk evaluation.

On May 14, 2020, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) published a proposal to clarify the Federal regulations about how OSMRE notifies State regulatory authorities, via issuance of a ten-day notice (TDN), of possible violations of any requirement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). This final rule adopts, with minor adjustments, much of OSMRE's proposals to streamline the process for OSMRE's coordination with State regulatory authorities in order to minimize duplication of inspections, enforcement, and administration of SMCRA. This final rule comports with the specific language of SMCRA, remedies internal disparate application of existing regulations, and will operate to ensure more effective enforcement of SMCRA. Additionally, the final rule will enhance the procedures for early identification of, and implementation of corrective action to address, State regulatory program issues.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a source-specific State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air Quality (DAQ), in final form, through a letter dated September 3, 2020. North Carolina's September 3, 2020, source- specific SIP revision requests that EPA incorporate into the SIP more stringent sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) permit limits than those currently contained in the SIP for the Blue Ridge Paper Products, LLC (also known as BRPP) facility located in the Beaverdam Township Area of Haywood County, North Carolina. Specifically, EPA is approving, into the SIP, specific SO<INF>2</INF> permit limits and associated operating restrictions, monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting (MRR) and testing compliance requirements established in BRPP's title V operating permit as permanent and enforceable SO<INF>2</INF> control measures. North Carolina submitted these limits to support its recommendation that EPA designate the Beaverdam Township Area as "attainment/unclassifiable" under the 2010 primary SO<INF>2</INF> national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or standard) (also referred to as the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS). The purpose of this rulemaking is not to take action on whether these SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limits are adequate for EPA to designate the Beaverdam Township Area as attainment under the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS. Instead, EPA will determine the air quality status and designate remaining undesignated areas for the 2010 1-hour SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS, including the Beaverdam Township Area, in a separate action. This SIP approval does not prejudge that future designation action.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is promulgating revisions to its major New Source Review (NSR) applicability regulations to clarify when the requirement to obtain a major NSR permit applies to a source proposing to undertake a physical change or a change in the method of operation (i.e., a project) under the major NSR preconstruction permitting programs. Under these programs, an existing major stationary source proposing to undertake a project must determine whether that project will constitute a major modification subject to the major NSR preconstruction permitting requirements by following a two-step applicability test. The first step is to determine if the proposed project would result in a "significant emissions increase" of a regulated NSR pollutant (Step 1). If the proposed project is determined to result in such an increase, the second step is to determine if the project would also result in a "significant net emissions increase" of that pollutant from the source (Step 2). In this action, we are promulgating revisions to our major NSR applicability regulations to clarify that both increases and decreases in emissions resulting from a proposed project can be considered in Step 1 of the major NSR major modification applicability test. We refer to the consideration of emissions increases and decreases in Step 1 as project emissions accounting.

FMCSA clarifies the definition of the terms "any agricultural commodity," "livestock," and "non-processed food," as the terms are used in the definition of "agricultural commodity" for the purposes of the Agency's "Hours of Service (HOS) of Drivers" regulations. Under current regulations, drivers transporting agricultural commodities, including livestock, from the source of the commodities to a location within 150 air miles of the source, during harvest and planting seasons as defined by each State, are exempt from the HOS requirements. Furthermore, the HOS requirement for a 30-minute rest break does not apply to drivers transporting livestock in interstate commerce while the livestock are on the commercial motor vehicle. This interim final rule (IFR) clarifies the meaning of these existing definitional terms to ensure that the HOS exemptions are utilized as Congress intended.

Federal commercial tilefish permit holders are prohibited from fishing for, catching, possessing, transferring or landing tilefish in the Tilefish Management Unit for the remainder of the 2020 fishing year. This action is required when NMFS projects that 100 percent of the 2020 total allowable landings will have been caught by the effective date.

This temporary rule extends emergency measures that extend portions of the fishing year 2019 carryover provisions in the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan into the 2020 fishing year published on June 1, 2020 (85 FR 33027), which is scheduled to expire on November 29, 2020. This action is necessary to prevent the Limited Access General Category Individual Fishery Quota vessels from losing any carryover granted by this emergency action and to prevent the Nantucket Lightship-West Access Area from opening on November 29, 2020. This action is intended to provide additional time for Limited Access General Category Individual Fishery Quota vessels to land the 2019 carryover allocation granted by the original emergency action and to provide the New England Fishery Management Council additional time to develop a plan for the management of the Nantucket Lightship-West Access Area while it remains closed.

This temporary final rule provides for a U.S. Department of State (Department) visa bond pilot program (Pilot Program) with specified parameters. The purpose of the Pilot Program is to assess the operational feasibility of posting, processing, and discharging visa bonds, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to help assess the burden on government agencies and identify any practical challenges related to visa bonds. The Pilot Program does not aim to assess whether issuing visa bonds will be effective in reducing the number of aliens who overstay their temporary business visitor/ tourist (B-1/B-2) visa. Visa applicants potentially subject to the Pilot Program include aliens who: Are applying for visas as temporary visitors for business or pleasure (B-1/B-2); are from countries with high visa overstay rates; and already have been approved by DHS for an inadmissibility waiver. Because this is a visa bond program, aliens traveling under the Visa Waiver Program fall outside the scope of the Pilot Program, as those travelers do not apply for visas. The Pilot Program is designed to apply to nationals of specified countries with high overstay rates to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits. The Pilot Program will run for six months. During that period, consular officers may require nonimmigrant visa applicants falling within the scope of the Pilot Program to post a bond in the amount of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 as a condition of visa issuance. The amount of the bond, should a bond be appropriate, will be determined by the consular officer based on the circumstances of the visa applicant.

This proposal would update the DOT NEPA procedures in response to the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ's) final rule updating its NEPA procedures and also incorporate provisions of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU); Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21); and the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act related to the Department's environmental review process. This proposed rule would modernize the Department's procedures and promote collaboration and efficiency in the implementation of NEPA. Finally, this proposal would also update the list of the Department's categorical exclusions consistent with the CEQ's regulations implementing NEPA.

While FDA intends to focus on recalls where there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals (Class I recalls), FDA may also publicize retail consignee lists for other food recalls as described in the guidance. FDA's goal is to publicize retail consignee lists for these food recalls where providing this additional information will be of the most use to consumers to help them identify recalled food and to determine whether that food is in their possession as effectively and quickly as possible.

We, NMFS, announce a 90-day finding on a petition to list the giant devil ray (Mobula mobular) as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The petition requests that we list the giant devil ray (M. mobular) as a distinct species with a limited range throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Information in our files indicates a recent taxonomic revision that found M. mobular and M. japanica (spinetail devilray) to be synonymous species (i.e., same taxon described and named more than once independently) with circumglobal distribution in tropical and warm temperate seas. The petition relies on obsolete information to identify the species, and therefore we find that the petition does not present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary special local regulation (SLR) in the Atlantic Ocean east of Fort Lauderdale, Florida in connection with the Ft Lauderdale Air Show. The Ft Lauderdale Air Show is listed as typically occurring annually over one weekend in May. This year, however, the sponsor changed the event's date to the weekend of November 20, 2020. The SLR extends north of the Port Everglades Inlet approximately six miles and is necessary to ensure the safety of the public, spectators, participating vessels, and marine environment during aerobatic maneuvers by low-flying airplanes and high-speed surface demonstrations during the Fort Lauderdale Air Show. This SLR prohibits persons and non-participant vessels from entering, transiting, anchoring in, or remaining within the regulated area unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) Miami or a designated representative.

The Department of State (the Department) is proposing revisions to the Code of Federal Regulations to amend requirements for accreditation and authorization by the United States to provide adoption services in intercountry adoption cases. This proposed rule amends regulations to provide clarification, updating, or other adaptation of familiar accreditation and approval standards for intercountry adoption. It includes long-awaited provisions for intercountry adoption by relatives. The new regulations simplify and streamline the process by limiting the number of adoption services the primary provider must provide and capitalizing on the adoptive family's understanding of local culture and institutions. It provides a comprehensive definition of relative to clarify the relationships that are encompassed in the amendments to the accreditation rule. Also featured in this proposed rule is a new focus on supporting children and families in the event their adoptive placement disrupts.

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a respondent is not required to respond to, an information collection unless it displays a currently valid control number issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The ASC is soliciting comment concerning a proposed collection method entitled "ASC Progress Report Standardized Instructions and Format for Interim and Final Progress Reporting." The ASC proposes to collect program progress data from ASC grantees and use this data to ensure grantees are proceeding in a satisfactory manner in meeting the approved goals and purpose of the project. The requirement for grantees to report on performance is OMB grants policy. Specific citations are contained in CFR part 200--Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, And Audit Requirements For Federal Awards.

These amendments implement the plain language reading of the "major source" and "area source" definitions of section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and provide that a major source can be reclassified to area source status at any time upon reducing its potential to emit (PTE) hazardous air pollutants (HAP) to below the major source thresholds (MST) of 10 tons per year (tpy) of any single HAP and 25 tpy of any combination of HAP. This rule also finalizes amendments to clarify the compliance dates, notification, and recordkeeping requirements that apply to sources choosing to reclassify to area source status and to sources that revert back to major source status, including a requirement for electronic notification.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is proposing to eliminate employment authorization eligibility for aliens who have final orders of removal but are temporarily released from custody on an order of supervision with one narrow exception. DHS proposes to continue to allow employment authorization for aliens for whom DHS has determined that their removal is impracticable because all countries from whom travel documents have been requested have affirmatively declined to issue a travel document and who establish economic necessity. DHS intends for this rule to reduce the incentive for aliens to remain in the United States after receiving a final order of removal and to strengthen protections for U.S. workers. DHS is also proposing to clarify that aliens who have been granted a deferral of removal based on the United States' obligations under the United Nations (U.N.) Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) are similarly situated to aliens granted withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and regulations implementing CAT, in that they cannot be removed to the country in question while the order deferring their removal is in place. As such, DHS is proposing to treat aliens granted CAT deferral of removal as employment authorized based upon the grant of deferral of removal.

This action proposes special conditions for magniX USA, Inc. (magniX), magni250 and magni500 model engines that operate using electrical technology installed on the aircraft for use as an aircraft engine. These engines have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards applicable to aircraft engines. The design feature is the use of an electric motor, controller, and high-voltage systems as the primary source of propulsion for an aircraft. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing an order under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) permanently debarring Richard M. Simon from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Richard M. Simon was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct that relates to the regulation of a drug product under the FD&C Act. Mr. Simon was given notice of the proposed permanent debarment and an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of August 6, 2020 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Simon had not responded. Mr. Simon's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this action.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is required by statute to develop and implement an integrated, automated entry and exit data system to match records, including biographic data and biometrics, of aliens entering and departing the United States. Although the current regulations provide that DHS may require certain aliens to provide biometrics when entering and departing the United States, they only authorize DHS to require certain aliens to provide biometrics upon departure under pilot programs at land ports and at up to 15 airports and seaports. To advance the legal framework for DHS to begin a comprehensive biometric entry-exit system, DHS is proposing to amend the regulations to remove the references to pilot programs and the port limitation to permit collection of biometrics from aliens departing from airports, land ports, seaports, or any other authorized point of departure. In addition, to enable U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to make the process for verifying the identity of aliens more efficient, accurate, and secure by using facial recognition technology, DHS is proposing to amend the regulations to provide that all aliens may be required to be photographed upon entry and/or departure. U.S. citizens may voluntarily opt out of participating in CBP's biometric verification program. This proposed rule also makes other minor conforming and editorial changes to the regulations.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the frecklebelly madtom (Noturus munitus), a fish species from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, as an endangered or threatened species and designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the frecklebelly madtom as an endangered or a threatened species throughout all of its range is not warranted. However, we determined that listing is warranted for a distinct population segment (DPS) of the frecklebelly madtom in the Upper Coosa River in Georgia and Tennessee. Accordingly, we propose to list the Upper Coosa River DPS of the frecklebelly madtom as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this DPS to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the DPS. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the Upper Coosa River DPS under the Act. In total, approximately 134 river miles (216 kilometers) in Georgia and Tennessee fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We also announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the Upper Coosa River DPS.

EPA is proposing to amend significant new use rules (SNURs) issued under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for certain chemical substances, which were the subject of a premanufacture notice (PMN) and a significant new use notice (SNUN). EPA is proposing these amendments following review of SNUNs for the chemical substances and based on review of new and existing data. Specifically, this action proposes to amend the SNURs to allow certain new uses reported in the SNUNs without additional notification requirements and modify the significant new use notification requirements based on the actions and determinations for the SNUN submissions.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all ATR--GIE Avions de Transport Regional Airplanes Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 airplanes. This AD was prompted by false activation of the stall warning system due to wiring damage on the wire bundle between an angle of attack (AOA) probe and the crew alerting computer. This AD requires a one-time inspection for discrepancies of the wire bundles between the left- and right-hand AOA probes and the crew alerting computer, and, depending on findings, applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff is issuing an exemption in response to a request dated September 1, 2020, from the Southern California Edison (SCE), for San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 (SONGS), from the requirement to investigate and report to the NRC when SCE does not receive notification of receipt of a shipment, or part of a shipment, of low-level radioactive waste within 20 days after transfer from the SONGS facility. SCE requested the time period to receive acknowledgement that the shipment has been received by the intended recipient be extended from 20 to 45 days. SCE requested this change to avoid an excessive administrative burden, because its operational experience indicates that these shipments may take more than 20 days to reach their destination.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (Office or USPTO) is setting or adjusting certain trademark fees, as authorized by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), as amended by the Study of Underrepresented Classes Chasing Engineering and Science Success Act of 2018 (SUCCESS Act). The changes will allow the USPTO to continue to recover the prospective aggregate costs of strategic and operational trademark and Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB or Board) goals (based on workload projections included in the USPTO fiscal year (FY) 2021 Congressional Justification), including associated administrative costs. They will also further USPTO strategic objectives by better aligning fees with costs, protecting the integrity of the trademark register, improving the efficiency of agency processes, and ensuring financial sustainability to facilitate effective trademark operations. USPTO has weighed carefully current economic conditions and the potential hardship that the fee increase could create for businesses and individuals. The Office paused development of the fee rule because of uncertainty about the economy earlier this year. The latest economic data point to continued recovery in many sectors of the economy. Because of this and the relatively small annual cost to businesses and individuals from USPTO's trademark applications and maintenance fees, the Office has decided to finalize the fee rule for implementation in January 2021.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision, submitted by the state of Iowa, through the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), to the EPA on May 26, 2016, for the purpose of providing for attainment of the 2010 1-hour primary Sulfur Dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in the Muscatine County, Iowa nonattainment area (NAA). The EPA concludes that Iowa has appropriately demonstrated that its SIP provides for attainment with the 2010 1-hour primary SO<INF>2</INF> NAAQS in the NAA, and that the plan meets the other applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act). As a part of approving the attainment demonstration, the EPA is taking final action to approve into the Iowa SIP the SO<INF>2</INF> emissions limits and associated compliance parameters for the NAA. The EPA is also applying a policy regarding startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) exemption provisions in the Iowa SIP that is consistent with the EPA's national policy. In light of this policy and the EPA's evaluation of Iowa's SIP, the EPA is withdrawing the SIP call issued to Iowa as part of the EPA's 2015 SSM SIP Action.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The collection involves an electronic distribution of a survey to gather information on current practices for pilots of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). The target information to be gathered is the common fatigue-related practices, and the minimum knowledge, skills, abilities (KSAs), testing, and staffing procedures required for operating UAS. The information to be collected will be used to inform future rulemaking and the development of supporting guidance. The information is necessary because the existing regulatory framework, to include the certification of airmen, was not designed with remote pilots in mind. To broadly integrate UAS and remote pilots into the National Airspace System, further rulemaking will be required to address remote pilot certification for air carrier operations and flight and duty time periods applicable to remote pilot air carrier operations.

On March 27, 2020, the President signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"). This bill provides $100 million for AFG-S to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically or internationally. Specifically, AFG-S funds shall be for the purchase of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and related supplies, including reimbursements for previously purchased PPE back to January 1, 2020. On May 12, 2020, FEMA published a Notice of availability announcing the application period for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 AFG-S Program which opened on April 28, 2020 and closed on May 15, 2020. By law, at least 25 percent of available AFG-S funds must be awarded to volunteer fire departments and at least another 25 percent must be awarded to combination fire departments. FEMA did not receive enough applications to award at least 25 percent of the available AFG-S funds to volunteer or combination fire departments under that initial application period. As a result, FEMA has opened a second application period for the remaining $31 million available. This second application--or AFG-S 2--is limited to volunteer and combination fire departments to fulfill this requirement. Volunteer and combination fire departments are eligible to apply in this round even if they had a successful application in the first round of AFG-S funding. However, such applications must support new or additional needs or capabilities. Departments that applied in the first round of AFG-S funding but were unsuccessful can reapply to be considered for funding in this round. Applications from the first round of AFG-S funding will not automatically carry forward to this round for consideration. Pursuant to the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, as amended, the Administrator of FEMA is publishing this notice describing the AFG-S 2 application process, deadlines, and award selection criteria. This notice explains the differences, if any, between these guidelines and those recommended by representatives of the national fire service leadership during a Criteria Development meeting, held April 20, 2020. The application period for the FY 2020 AFG-S Program opened on October 6, 2020, and closed on November 13, 2020, and was announced on the AFG website at https://www.fema.gov/ grants/preparedness/firefighters, as well as at http://www.grants.gov.

FMCSA grants the petition submitted by the Washington Trucking Associations (WTA) requesting a determination that the State of Washington's Meal and Rest Break rules (MRB rules) are preempted as applied to property-carrying commercial motor vehicle drivers subject to FMCSA's hours of service (HOS) regulations. Federal law provides for preemption of State laws on commercial motor vehicle safety that are additional to or more stringent than Federal regulations if they (1) have no safety benefit; (2) are incompatible with Federal regulations; or (3) would cause an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. FMCSA has determined that Washington's MRB rules are laws on commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safety, that they are more stringent than the Agency's HOS regulations, that they have no safety benefits that extend beyond those that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) already provide, that they are incompatible with the Federal HOS regulations, and that they cause an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce. The Washington MRB rules, therefore, are preempted.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering an amendment request from Portland General Electric Company (PGE) to amend License No. SNM-2509 for the Trojan Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI), located in Columbia County, Oregon. The amendment would revise the safety analysis report (SAR) description of the licensee's evaluation of explosion accident events. As part of its review, the NRC performed an environmental assessment (EA) of the proposed action. The NRC concluded that the proposed action would have no significant environmental impact. Accordingly, the NRC staff is issuing a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed amendment.

In this document, known as a Candidate Notice of Review (CNOR), we, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), present an updated list of domestic plant and animal species that we regard as candidates for or have proposed for addition to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. This document also includes our findings on resubmitted petitions and describes our progress in revising the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (Lists) during the period October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2020. Combined with other decisions for individual species that were published separately from this CNOR in the past year, the current number of domestic species that are candidates for listing is 11. Identification of candidate species can assist environmental planning efforts by providing advance notice of potential listings, and by allowing landowners and resource managers to alleviate threats and thereby possibly remove the need to list species as endangered or threatened. Even if we subsequently list a candidate species, the early notice provided here could result in more options for species management and recovery by prompting earlier candidate conservation measures to alleviate threats to the species. This document also adds the Sonoran desert tortoise back to the candidate list as a result of an August 3, 2020, court-approved settlement agreement.

This final regulation establishes the requirements for registering with the Department of Labor as a "pooled plan provider" for "pooled employer plans" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act) provides that newly permitted pooled plan providers can begin offering pooled employer plans on January 1, 2021, but requires such persons to register with the Secretary of Labor before beginning operations. This final regulation also establishes a new form--EBSA Form PR (Pooled Plan Provider Registration)--as the required filing format for pooled plan provider registrations. The Form PR must be filed electronically with the Department of Labor. Filing the Form PR with the Department of Labor also satisfies the SECURE Act requirement to register with the Department of the Treasury. This final regulation affects persons wishing to serve as pooled plan providers, defined contribution pension benefit plans that are operated as pooled employer plans, employers participating in such plans, and participants and beneficiaries covered by such plans.

In the Sturgeon decision, the Court held that National Park Service regulations apply exclusively to public lands (meaning federally owned lands and waters) within the external boundaries of National Park System units in Alaska. Lands which are not federally owned, including submerged lands under navigable waters, are not part of the units subject to the National Park Service's ordinary regulatory authority.

This temporary rule implements an interim catch limit (ICL) of 13,000 lb of American Samoa bottomfish for fishing years 2020 and 2021 during the effective period of the rule. NMFS will monitor catches, and if the fishery reaches the ICL within a fishing year, we will close the fishery in Federal waters through the end of the fishing year, or through the end of the effective period of this rule, whichever comes first. These interim management measures are necessary to reduce overfishing of American Samoa bottomfish while minimizing socio- economic impacts to fishing communities. This temporary rule supports the long-term sustainability of American Samoa bottomfish.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance entitled "Certificates of Confidentiality; Guidance for Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators, Researchers, Industry, and Food and Drug Administration Staff." This guidance is intended to explain FDA implementation of the revised statutory provisions applicable to the request for, and issuance of, a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC). The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) amended the statutory provisions relating to the issuance of CoCs. A CoC is intended to help protect the privacy of human subject research participants from whom sensitive and identifiable information is being collected or used in furtherance of the research. Historically, a CoC generally protected a researcher from being compelled in a legal proceeding to disclose identifiable sensitive information about the research participant, created or compiled for the research. As amended, a CoC prohibits a researcher from disclosing such information unless a specified exception applies. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title issued on November 25, 2019.

We are revising our rules to clarify when and how administrative appeals judges (AAJ) on our Appeals Council may hold hearings and issue decisions. The Appeals Council already has the authority to hold hearings and issue decisions under our existing regulations, but we have not exercised this authority or explained the circumstances under which it would be appropriate for the Appeals Council to assume responsibility for holding a hearing and issuing a decision. This final rule will ensure the Appeals Council is not limited in the type of claims for which it may hold hearings. We expect that this rule will increase our adjudicative capacity when needed, and allow us to adjust more quickly to fluctuating short-term workloads, such as when an influx of cases reaches the hearing level. Our ability to use our limited resources more effectively will help us quickly optimize our hearings capacity, which in turn will allow us to issue accurate, timely, high-quality decisions.

In addition, in response to public comment, the rule required a business concern to recertify its size and/or socioeconomic status for all set-aside orders under unrestricted multiple award contracts, unless the contract authorized limited pools of concerns for which size and/or status was required.

The FAA is announcing the availability of and requesting comments on the Draft PEA for the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) Reentry Site Operator License. The FAA has prepared the Draft PEA to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the FAA issuing a Reentry Site Operator License to Space Florida for the operation of a commercial space reentry site at the SLF located at the Cape Canaveral Spaceport, which includes the Kennedy Space Center and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A programmatic document is a type of general, broad National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review from which subsequent NEPA documents can be tiered, focusing on the issues specific to the subsequent action. If a commercial space operator applies to the FAA for a reentry license to conduct reentry operations at the SLF, a separate environmental document, tiering off the PEA, would be developed to support the issuance of a reentry license to the prospective reentry operator. The tiered environmental document would be a more detailed analysis based on vehicle specific operations.

This rule revises the minimum payments that HUD distributes to states that participate in the Manufactured Housing Program as State Administrative Agencies (SAAs) in order to provide for a more equitable guarantee of minimum funding and to reduce administrative burden. This rule changes the minimum payments to SAAs so that payments are based on SAAs' participation in the production or siting of new manufactured homes, regardless of whether the state was fully or conditionally approved to participate in the program as of December 27, 2000. This rule also changes the formula for minimum payments to SAAs by increasing the amount paid to SAAs for each transportable section of new manufactured housing that is produced in that state, and by ensuring that each state participating in the program will receive an annual payment no less than the amount of cumulative payments resulting from production and shipments due to that State for the Fiscal Year 2014 period.

The final rules set forth requirements for group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose cost-sharing information upon request to a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or his or her authorized representative), including an estimate of the individual's cost-sharing liability for covered items or services furnished by a particular provider. Under the final rules, plans and issuers are required to make this information available on an internet website and, if requested, in paper form, thereby allowing a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or his or her authorized representative) to obtain an estimate and understanding of the individual's out-of-pocket expenses and effectively shop for items and services. The final rules also require plans and issuers to disclose in-network provider negotiated rates, historical out-of- network allowed amounts, and drug pricing information through three machine-readable files posted on an internet website, thereby allowing the public to have access to health coverage information that can be used to understand health care pricing and potentially dampen the rise in health care spending. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also finalizes amendments to its medical loss ratio (MLR) program rules to allow issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage to receive credit in their MLR calculations for savings they share with enrollees that result from the enrollees shopping for, and receiving care from, lower-cost, higher-value providers.

NMFS received a request from Dominion Energy Virginia (Dominion) on September 29, 2020, for a modification to the incidental harassment authorization (IHA) that was issued on August 28, 2020. This initial IHA allowed Dominion to take nine species of marine mammals, by Level B harassment, incidental to marine site characterization surveys conducted in the areas of the Commercial Lease of Submerged Lands for Renewable Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Offshore Virginia (Lease No. OCS-A-0483) as well as in coastal waters where an export cable corridor will be established in support of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Commercial (CVOW Commercial) Project. Dominion was recording take of Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) by Level B harassment at a rate that would exceed the authorized limit on this species and therefore, NMFS is proposing to modify the IHA to increase authorized take by Level B harassment of spotted dolphin. The mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures remain the same as prescribed in the initial IHA and no additional take was requested for other species. NMFS will consider public comments on the requested modification prior to making any final decision and agency responses will be summarized in the final notice of our decision.

In this document, the Commission revises the regulations governing the notices that cable operators must provide subscribers and local franchise authorities (LFAs) regarding rate and service changes. Specifically, document amends the rules to clarify that when service changes occur due to retransmission consent or program carriage negotiations that fail within the last 30 days of a contract, cable operators must provide notice to subscribers "as soon as possible," rather than 30 days in advance. The document also eliminates the requirement that cable operators not subject to rate regulation provide 30 days' advance notice to LFAs of rate or service changes. Finally, it eliminates the requirement that cable operators provide notice of any significant change to the information required in the certain annual notices, as well as adopts several non- substantive revisions that clarify the rules and eliminate redundant provisions. The Commission concludes that these changes will make consumer notices more meaningful and accurate, reduce consumer confusion, better ensure that subscribers receive the information they need to make informed choices about their service options, and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens.

This advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) informs of and seeks public comment on changes that HUD is considering for the minimum payments that HUD distributes to states that participate in the Manufactured Housing Program as State Administrative Agencies (SAAs). HUD is considering two changes intended to achieve more equitable payments that more appropriately reflect state responsibilities and to incentivize continued and new state partnerships: First, HUD is considering payment to each SAA for its participation as partners in each of the various program elements, including SAA roles, participation in joint monitoring, and for administering installation and dispute resolution programs. Second, HUD is considering a change in annual funding from minimum end of Fiscal Year lump sum payments to payments for each operational element at the end of each Fiscal Year, and a sunset provision for states to strategize and plan for this change. HUD is seeking public comment on questions related to these changes and will consider the comments in developing a proposed rule to further streamline and enhance the minimum payment formula. This ANPR will also be shared with the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC) and the relevant MHCC subcommittee and all state partners for feedback and comments prior to moving forward in the rulemaking process. A Proposed Rule developed in consideration of this ANPR will also be shared with the MHCC prior to moving forward in the rulemaking process in accordance with statutory requirements.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the sickle darter (Percina williamsi), a fish species from the upper Tennessee River drainage in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the sickle darter as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.
