This proposed AD was prompted by the manufacturer reducing the life limit for the affected left-hand rear mount link assembly. This proposed AD would require revising the Airworthiness Limitations section (ALS) of the GE CF6-80C2 Engine Manual, GEK92451, and the operator's existing approved continuous airworthiness maintenance program (CAMP). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

On October 25, 2021, the President issued a Proclamation, "Advancing the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the COVID-19 Pandemic." Pursuant to this Proclamation, the President has implemented a global suspension and restriction on entry for noncitizens who are nonimmigrants seeking to enter the United States by air travel and who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The Proclamation directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to implement the Proclamation as it applies to public health. As such, CDC announces an Amended Order implementing the Proclamation requiring noncitizens who are nonimmigrants seeking to enter the United States by air travel to provide proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to boarding an aircraft to fly to the United States, with only limited exceptions in accordance with the Proclamation. This Amended Order was signed by the CDC Director on October 30, 2021, and supersedes the previous Order signed by the CDC Director on October 25, 2021.

In response to requests from interested parties, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) is rescinding the administrative review, in part, of the antidumping duty order on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic products (solar products) from Taiwan during the period of review (POR), February 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. Specifically, Commerce is rescinding the review with respect to eleven companies under review, including the mandatory respondents, Inventec Solar Energy Corporation (ISEC) and Sino-American Silicon Products Inc. (SAS), because all requests to review these companies have been timely withdrawn. Moreover, Commerce preliminarily determines that sixteen of the companies under review made no shipments of solar products from Taiwan during the POR. Finally, with respect to the companies that did not submit no-shipment certifications and were not selected as mandatory respondents, we have determined to preliminarily apply a rate of 7.89 percent, i.e., the non-selected rate from the prior administrative review under this antidumping duty order. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, received a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 from JADE Energy, LLC, for authorization to take by Level B harassment a small number of polar bears from the Southern Beaufort Sea (SBS) stock incidental to oil and gas exploratory activities scheduled to occur between December 1, 2021, through November 30, 2022. These activities include mobilization, constructing ice roads and ice pads, drilling wells, and associated cleanup in the Prudhoe Bay Unit and Point Thomson Unit of the North Slope of Alaska. Mobilization would occur in December 2021, along a winter trail stretching east from Deadhorse, Alaska, to Point Thomson, Alaska. Prepacking of snow and construction of ice roads and pads would begin mid-December 2021, and drilling would begin at JADE #1 pad in late-January 2022. If conditions are favorable, drilling on JADE #2 pad would take place in mid-March 2022, preceding cleanup activities, which are proposed to be completed by July 15, 2022. We estimate these activities may result in the nonlethal incidental take of up to two SBS stock polar bears. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for take of two SBS stock polar bears by Level B harassment only. No lethal or Level A take of polar bears is likely or requested, and, therefore, such take is not included in this proposed authorization.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109A, A109A II, A109C, A109E, A109K2, A109S, AW109SP, A119, and AW119 MKII helicopters. This AD was prompted by a report of damage to a rigid connecting link (rod), and loosening of the nut on the upper rod end. This AD requires a visual inspection of the affected rods for damage, cracks, or abnormal play, and corrective actions if necessary, as specified in a European Aviation Safety Agency (now European Union Aviation Safety Agency) (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

Source: Federal Register

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of the Draft Waste Incidental to Reprocessing Evaluation for the Test Bed Initiative Demonstration, U.S. Department of Energy (Draft WIR Evaluation). The Draft WIR Evaluation concerns DOE's proposed Test Bed Initiative (TBI) Demonstration. Under the proposed TBI Demonstration, approximately 2,000 gallons of waste from tank SY-101 at the Hanford Site in Washington will be pretreated to remove most key radionuclides, then solidified (grouted) offsite and subsequently disposed of at a licensed and permitted disposal facility outside of the State of Washington. The Draft WIR Evaluation demonstrates that the pretreated and solidified waste will be incidental to reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, will not be high-level radioactive waste (HLW), and may be managed as low-level radioactive waste (LLW). DOE prepared the Draft WIR Evaluation pursuant to DOE Order 435.1, Radioactive Waste Management, and DOE Manual 435.1-1, chg 3, Radioactive Waste Management Manual. DOE is consulting with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) concerning the Draft WIR Evaluation. DOE is also making the Draft WIR Evaluation available for comments from States, Tribal Nations, stakeholders and the public. After consultation with NRC, carefully considering comments received, and performing any necessary revisions of analyses and technical documents, DOE plans to prepare a final WIR Evaluation. Based on the final WIR Evaluation, DOE may determine, in a future WIR Determination, whether the pretreated and solidified waste is incidental to reprocessing, is non-HLW, and may be managed as LLW.

DHS S&T will submit the following Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and clearance in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The survey will collect information from the public regarding applications of artificial intelligence (AI), including facial recognition. DHS has already used or piloted AI-based technologies in several of its key functions, including customs and border protection, transportation security, and investigations. However, AI in general and facial recognition in particular are not without public controversy, including concerns about bias, security, and privacy. Therefore, understanding how the public perceives these technologies, and then designing and deploying them in a manner responsive to the public's concerns, is critical in gaining public support for DHS's use of these technologies.

The NITRD Subcommittee will hold a virtual public meeting to mark the 30th anniversary of the signing of the High-Performance Computing (HPC) Act of 1991 and the launching of the High-Performance Computing and Communications Program, now known as the NITRD Program. One of the key parts of this legislation was to establish an effective mechanism to coordinate HPC, networking, and information technology (IT) research and development (R&D) undertaken by the agencies of the Federal Government. The legislation also expanded Federal funding support for HPC and IT R&D to ensure continued technological leadership in these areas by the United States. The Act aimed to provide U.S. researchers and educators, as well as government and the public, with the advanced computing and information resources they needed for achievement of personal, business, and public goals. The NITRD mission has expanded over the last three decades as the capabilities of advanced computing, networking, and IT technologies increased dramatically. Join us as we recognize and celebrate the origins and expansion of America's IT innovation highway.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Pacific Aerospace Limited Model 750XL airplanes. This AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as insufficient clearance between the engine mount, the Beta control rod, and the inter-turbine temperature (ITT) sensing probe that could lead to chafing damage. This AD requires inspecting the engine mount, the temperature probe, and the reversing cable for damage, and taking any necessary corrective actions. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB," "Agency," or "Board") seeks public input on the use of videoconference technology to conduct, in whole or in part, all aspects and phases of unfair labor practice and representation case hearings and on potential amendments to its procedural rules regarding the use of videoconference technology. The Board's current Rules and Regulations provide for the taking of a single witness's testimony via video in an unfair labor practice proceeding upon a showing of good cause based on compelling circumstances. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board, through adjudication, sanctioned entirely remote hearings in both unfair labor practice and representation cases. The Board has no intention to permanently replace in-person hearings with virtual hearings. To the contrary, once conditions permit, the Board intends to resume conducting in-person hearings. But, based on the Board's experience during the pandemic, the Board is considering whether to retain virtual hearings as an option for future use. Accordingly, the Board solicits responses to targeted questions regarding, among other things, stakeholders' experiences with remote hearings during the pandemic; the benefits and/or drawbacks of using videoconference technology to conduct remote hearings; and the need for, and content of, potential amendments to the Board's rules regarding use of videoconference technology to conduct remote hearings.

The Drug Enforcement Administration proposes to remove [\18\F]FP-CIT (chemical names: [\18\F]N-[omega]-fluoropropyl-[beta]- CIT; fluorine-18-N-3-fluoropropyl-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4- iodophenyl)tropane; [\18\F]fluoropropylcarbomethoxy nortropane) from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This scheduling action is pursuant to the CSA which requires that such actions be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing through formal rulemaking. [\18\F]FP-CIT is currently a schedule II controlled substance because it can be derived from cocaine, a schedule II substance, via ecgonine, also a schedule II substance. This action would remove the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to controlled substances, including those specific to schedule II controlled substances, on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, reverse distribute, dispense, conduct research, import, export, or conduct chemical analysis) or propose to handle [\18\F]FP-CIT.

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is withdrawing a proposed rule published in the Federal Register on December 20, 2016. The proposed rule would have identified criteria that the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) could consider when determining whether a live poultry dealer's use of a system for ranking poultry growers for settlement purposes is unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive or gives an undue or unreasonable preference, advantage, prejudice, or disadvantage. Proposed amendments would also have clarified that, absent demonstration of a legitimate business justification, failing to use a poultry grower ranking system in a fair manner after applying the identified criteria is unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive and a violation of the Packers and Stockyards Act, regardless of whether it harms or is likely to harm competition. The Secretary has determined to withdraw the 2016 proposed rule and develop revised proposals pertaining to poultry grower ranking systems.

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is considering amending Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients (Title VI Circular) to incorporate lessons learned since its issuance on October 1, 2012. The Title VI Circular provides guidance and instructions to FTA recipients of Federal financial assistance on how to comply with requirements under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the DOT Title VI regulations at 49 CFR part 21, which prohibit discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs. The agency is seeking suggestions from all transit stakeholders--including transit agencies, transit riders and community members, planning officials, States, cities, and the private sector--on enhancements that could be made to the Title VI Circular to provide clarity, to ensure Title VI requirements are met, and to advance equity. Specifically, FTA seeks input on requirements related to public participation, service and fare equity, facility equity analyses, implementation of rider conduct policies, and additional technical resources for determining and documenting disparate impact.

This provision requires that each state's SIP contain adequate provisions to prohibit emissions from within the state from significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of the NAAQS in other states. This requirement is part of the broader "infrastructure" requirements of CAA section 110(a)(2), which are designed to ensure that the structural components of each state's air quality management program are adequate to meet the state's responsibilities under the CAA.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 M-NG, and DA 42 NG airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as dissolved or detached fuel tank hose material entering the main fuel tank chambers, which could result in restricted fuel flow with consequent fuel starvation. This proposed AD would require removing the fuel tank connection hoses from service and inspecting the fuel tank connection hoses for damage and detached rubber material. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

NMFS issues this final rule to implement Amendment 14 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Salmon Fisheries in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) Off Alaska (Salmon FMP). Amendment 14 will incorporate the Cook Inlet EEZ Subarea into the Salmon FMP's West Area, thereby bringing the Cook Inlet EEZ Subarea and the commercial salmon fisheries that occur within it under Federal management by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and NMFS. This action will apply the prohibition on commercial salmon fishing that is currently established in the West Area to the newly added Cook Inlet EEZ Subarea. This final rule is necessary to comply with a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruling and to ensure the Salmon FMP is consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). This final rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Salmon FMP, and other applicable laws.

Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/02/2021-23253/flight-attendant-duty-period-limitations-and-rest-requirements
This action arises out of a statutory mandate in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which requires rulemaking to increase the minimum rest period for flight attendants in domestic, flag, and supplemental operations who are scheduled for a duty period of 14 hours or less. The statute also requires rulemaking to prohibit a reduction of the rest period under any circumstances. Consistent with the statutory mandate, the FAA proposes to amend its regulations to ensure that flight attendants scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours or less are given a scheduled rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours and that the rest period is not reduced under any circumstances.

NMFS proposes to implement an annual catch limit (ACL) of 492,000 lb (223,167 kg) for Deep 7 bottomfish in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) for each of the fishing years 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023- 24. As an in-season accountability measure (AM), if NMFS projects that the fishery will reach the ACL in any given fishing year, we would close the commercial and non-commercial fisheries in Federal waters for the remainder of the fishing year. As a post-season AM, if NMFS determines that the catch exceeded the ACL in a fishing year, we would reduce the ACL for the following fishing year by the amount of the overage. The proposed rule supports the long-term sustainability of Deep 7 bottomfish.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Austro Engine GmbH E4 and E4P model diesel piston engines. This AD was prompted by reports of failure of the high-pressure pump (HPP) driving gear and a subsequent determination that a batch of HPP driving gears may have been damaged during assembly. This AD requires, for engines with an affected cylinder head, inspection of the HPP driving gear and, depending on the results of the inspection, replacement of the HPP driving gear with a part eligible for installation. This AD also requires, for engines with an affected HPP driving gear, replacement of the HPP driving gear either before further flight or within a certain number of flight hours after the effective date of this AD. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The PSN contains information pertaining to the areas available for leasing, certain provisions and conditions of the lease, auction details, lease forms, criteria for evaluating competing bids, award procedures, appeal procedures, and lease execution procedures. The issuance of a lease resulting from this sale, if any, would not constitute an approval of project-specific plans to develop offshore wind energy. Such plans, if submitted by the lessee, would be subject to subsequent environmental, technical, and public reviews prior to a decision on whether the proposed development should be authorized.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a virtual public meeting to discuss proposed recommendations for the reauthorization of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) for fiscal years (FYs) 2023 through 2027. GDUFA amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to authorize FDA to assess and collect fees to support human generic drug activities. The current legislative authority for GDUFA expires at the end of September 2022. At that time, new legislation will be required for FDA to continue to assess and collect generic drug user fees for future fiscal years. The FD&C Act directs FDA, following negotiations with the regulated industry and periodic consultations with other stakeholders, to present recommendations for reauthorization of the GDUFA program to the relevant Congressional committees, publish the recommendations in the Federal Register, provide for a period of 30 days for the public to provide written comments on such recommendations, and hold a meeting at which the public may present its views on such recommendations. FDA will then consider such public views and comments and revise such recommendations as necessary.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), propose new revisions to the existing experimental population designation of the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi) in the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area (MWEPA) in Arizona and New Mexico under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). We are taking this action in response to a court-ordered remand of our January 16, 2015, final rule revising the regulations for the nonessential experimental population of the Mexican wolf. This document proposes to modify the population objective, establish a genetic objective, and temporarily restrict three of the forms of take of Mexican wolves in the MWEPA that we adopted in the January 16, 2015, final rule. We are proposing these revisions to ensure the long-term conservation and recovery of the Mexican wolf. In addition, this document proposes to maintain the nonessential designation for the experimental population. We are not proposing to revise the geographic boundaries of the MWEPA. We are seeking comment from the public on the proposed regulatory revisions and on a draft supplemental environmental impact statement for the proposed revisions. We also announce public information sessions and public hearings on this proposed rule and the associated draft supplemental environmental impact statement.

The NPRM would have required repetitively inspecting and adjusting the throttle linkage. The NPRM was prompted by reports of the throttle linkage separating from the engine carburetor shaft, which could result in loss of throttle control. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined, based upon the available information, that there is not an unsafe condition in the product that is likely to develop in other products of the same type design.

On May 6, 2021, the U.S. Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and the White House Council on Environmental Quality released a preliminary report on Conserving and Restoring America the Beautiful (Report). The Report recommends a decade-long national initiative to advance locally led conservation and restoration in public, private, and tribal lands and waters toward addressing three threats: Disappearance of nature, climate change, and inequitable access to the outdoors. Guided by eight core principles and six focus areas for early action and progress in the Report, NOAA is seeking public input on how NOAA should, using its existing authorities and associated measures, conserve and restore America's ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes.

The Agency did not receive any comments on the notice. Further, the registrant did not withdraw their request. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues in this notice a cancellation order granting the requested amendment to terminate DCNA use on geranium and hydrangeas.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice invites the general public and other public agencies to comment on this proposed information collection associated with SNAP benefit storage and expungement provisions of the 2008 and 2018 Farm Bills. This collection involves both a new collection and an existing collection in use without an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The new collection is for providing SNAP households advance or concurrent notice prior to the State agency expunging unused SNAP benefits from the household's Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) account due to nine months of account inactivity. The existing collection is for providing SNAP households advance or concurrent notice of State agency action to store unused SNAP benefits offline due to three or more months of account inactivity and for those households to seek reinstatement of benefits prior to permanent expungement. A 60- Day Federal Register Notice for this proposed information collection was previously published on February 11, 2020 (85 FR 7716). The Department was unable to submit an Information Collection Request (ICR) to OMB within a reasonable timeframe following the publication of the 2020 notice. In an effort to be fully transparent, the Department is publishing the notice again for public comment and plans to submit an ICR to OMB following an analysis of comments.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a revision to the State of Nevada's state implementation plan (SIP) for Clark County. The revision consists of an update to certain elements of the maintenance plan for the Clark County air quality planning area for the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS or ``standards''), including certain emissions inventories and motor vehicle emissions budgets. The EPA is approving the SIP revision because the Clark County ozone maintenance plan, as revised, continues to provide for maintenance of the 1997 ozone NAAQS and will not interfere with attainment or reasonable further progress of the other NAAQS, and the motor vehicle emissions budgets meet the applicable transportation conformity requirements.

Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/10/28/2021-23449/schedule-of-fees-for-consular-services-passport-security-surcharge
This rule adopts as final the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register on March 26, 2021. This final rule adjusts the Schedule of Fees for Consular Services (Schedule of Fees) by increasing the passport book security surcharge (PSS) from $60 to $80. This increase reflects increases in security-related costs for processing passports attributed to the PSS. Increases in security- related costs are largely due to a 37 percent increase in compensation costs for passport adjudicators and enhanced printing technology costs for the Next Generation (NextGen) passport book. Based on FY 2022 projections of 15.9 million passport products for which the PSS is included as part of the overall fee (passport books, and passport books and card combinations), the Department anticipates an additional $318 million in revenue. The Department retains all PSS revenue, and it is used to cover the costs associated with passport application processing that support enhanced border security. The adjustment will result in a more accurate alignment of the fees for consular services to the costs of providing the services.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-11-15, which applies to certain International Aero Engines AG (IAE) V2500 model turbofan engines. AD 2021-11-15 requires performance of an ultrasonic inspection (USI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd-stage disk and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the HPT 1st-stage disk or HPT 2nd-stage disk. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-11-15, the FAA determined the need to clarify the compliance time for inspection of any HPT 1st-stage disk or HPT 2nd-stage disk that is installed on a low-thrust model engine but had been previously operated on a high-thrust model engine. This proposed AD would require performance of a USI of the HPT 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd-stage disk and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement of the HPT 1st-stage disk or HPT 2nd-stage disk. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This notice seeks comments on two updated draft recommendations for (1) providing contraception and (2) screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, as part of the HRSA- supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines (Guidelines). These updated draft recommendations have been developed through a national cooperative agreement, the Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI), by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Under applicable law, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group and individual health insurance coverage must include coverage, without cost sharing, for certain preventive services, including those provided for in the HRSA-supported Women's Preventive Services Guidelines (Guidelines). The Departments of Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Treasury have previously issued regulations, which describe how group health plans and health insurance issuers apply the coverage requirements, including the use of reasonable medical management.

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed regulatory and statutory amendment to the Wyoming coal program (Wyoming program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). On March 2, 2016 the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council approved a number of revisions to the rules governing coal exploration by drilling under the Wyoming program. Specifically, the proposed revisions include more detailed instructions for plugging and sealing drill holes, incorporate best management practices, and make additional formatting and organizational changes. Additionally, between 1978 and 2007 the Wyoming state legislature enacted a number of revisions to the statutes governing coal exploration by drilling. The proposed statutory revisions reflect organizational updates at the Wyoming Land Quality Division, correct a typographical error, provide more detailed instructions for plugging and sealing drill holes, incorporate provisions for the awarding of attorney fees and other litigation costs, and include more detailed instructions for bond release. Accordingly, the State submitted this proposal to OSMRE at its own initiative. This document gives the times and locations that the Wyoming program and this proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing approval of State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of South Carolina, through the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC or Department), on April 24, 2020. The SIP revisions update the State's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) regulations. Specifically, the SIP revisions add and update several definitions for consistency with the Federal regulations, update public participation requirements for PSD, clarify the applicability of ``source impact analysis'' for PSD, add an emissions offset banking provision for NNSR, and make administrative updates, such as typographical corrections and renumbering. Finally, the changes incorporate language that addresses the public notice rule provisions for NNSR, which removes the mandatory requirements to provide public notice in a newspaper and instead allows for electronic notice (``e- notice'') as an alternate noticing option for the State. EPA is approving these revisions pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) and implementing Federal regulations.

In November 2012, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) published a consumer product safety standard for infant swings under section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The standard incorporated by reference the ASTM voluntary standard for infant swings that was in effect at that time. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. Consistent with the CPSIA update process, in January 2021, the Commission issued a direct final rule to revise the incorporation by reference for the mandatory infant swings standard, to reflect ASTM's 2020 revised voluntary standard for infant swings. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for infant swings to incorporate by reference ASTM's 2021 version of the voluntary standard.

The NCUA Board (the Board) is updating the NCUA's supervisory rating system from CAMEL to CAMELS by adding the "S" (Sensitivity to Market Risk) component to the existing CAMEL rating system and redefining the "L" (Liquidity Risk) component. The benefits of adding the "S" component are to enhance transparency and allow the NCUA and federally insured natural person and corporate credit unions to better distinguish between liquidity risk ("L") and sensitivity to market risk ("S"). The addition of "S" also enhances consistency between the supervision of credit unions and financial institutions supervised by the other banking agencies. The effective date of the rule will be April 1, 2022. The Board plans to implement the addition of the "S" rating component and a redefined "L" rating for examinations and contacts started on or after April 1, 2022.

The FDIC is issuing a final rule to amend Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies (Real Estate Lending Standards). The purpose of the final rule is to incorporate consideration of the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) rule, which does not require electing institutions to calculate tier 2 capital or total capital, into the Real Estate Lending Standards. The final rule allows a consistent approach for calculating the ratio of loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits (LTV Limits) at all FDIC-supervised institutions, using a methodology that approximates the historical methodology the FDIC has followed for calculating this measurement without requiring institutions to calculate tier 2 capital. The final rule also avoids any regulatory burden that could arise if an FDIC-supervised institution subsequently decides to switch between different capital frameworks.

NMFS proposes a 2022 limit of 2,000 metric tons (t) of longline-caught bigeye tuna for each U.S. Pacific territory (American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), collectively "the territories"). NMFS would allow each territory to allocate up to 1,500 t to U.S. longline fishing vessels through specified fishing agreements that meet established criteria. However, the overall allocation limit among all territories may not exceed 3,000 t. As an accountability measure, NMFS would monitor, attribute, and restrict (if necessary) catches of longline-caught bigeye tuna, including catches made under a specified fishing agreement. The proposed catch limits and accountability measures would support the long-term sustainability of fishery resources of the U.S. Pacific Islands.

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains controls on the export, reexport and transfer (in-country) of dual-use items and less sensitive military items pursuant to the Export Administration Regulations, including the Commerce Control List (CCL). Certain items that could be of potential concern for export control purposes are not yet listed on the CCL or controlled multilaterally, because they are emerging technologies. Among these items is Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, which includes, inter alia, neural-controlled interfaces, mind-machine interfaces, direct neural interfaces, and brain-machine interfaces. BIS is seeking public comments on the potential uses of this technology, particularly with respect to its impact on U.S. national security (e.g., whether such technology could provide the United States, or any of its adversaries, with a qualitative military or intelligence advantage). This document also requests public comments on how to ensure that the scope of any controls that may be imposed on this technology would be effective (in terms of protecting U.S. national security interests) and appropriate (with respect to minimizing their potential impact on legitimate commercial or scientific applications).

NMFS proposes revisions to monitoring provisions that specify exemptions for non-groundfish trawl vessels participating in the Pacific coast pink shrimp fishery and for groundfish midwater trawl vessels. In a final rule on vessel movement, monitoring, and declaration management for the Pacific coast groundfish fishery published on June 11, 2020, vessels in the pink shrimp trawl fishery were incorrectly included with other open access non-groundfish trawl vessels that became subject to a higher position transmission rate on their NMFS type-approved vessel monitoring system (VMS) units. This proposed rule would correct the error and return the required transmission rate for vessels in the pink shrimp trawl fishery to once every 60 minutes, as recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council. This proposed rule would also correct a citation error in the VMS regulations with regards to exemptions for midwater trawl vessels, as well as a typographical error in the trawl fishery prohibitions.

The Coast Guard proposes to change the operating schedule that governs the California Department of Transportation (Route 4) highway bridge, across Old River, mile 14.8, between Victoria Island and Byron Tract, California. This action is proposed due to the infrequent amount of vessels requiring drawbridge openings on the waterway and will reduce unnecessary staffing of the drawbridge during periods of navigational inactivity while continuing to meet the reasonable needs of navigation. The proposed rulemaking would require vessels to provide a four-hour advance notification for a bridge opening. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.

NMFS is adjusting the 2022 total allowable catch (TAC) amounts for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod fisheries. This action is necessary because NMFS has determined these TACs are incorrectly specified, and will ensure the BSAI pollock, Atka mackerel, and Pacific cod TACs are the appropriate amounts based on the best available scientific information. This action is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area.

In accordance with the Presidential directive of January 20, 2021, "Revocation of Certain Executive Orders Concerning Federal Regulation," and in order to ensure appropriate flexibilities to site- specific inspection work, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is rescinding its March 2, 2020 final rule describing certain Agency procedures for conducting on-site civil inspections. This rule applies to on-site civil inspections conducted by federally credentialed EPA civil inspectors, federally credentialed contractors and Senior Environmental Employment employees conducting inspections on behalf of EPA.

NMFS published a final rule on December 23, 2021, announcing routine inseason adjustments to management measures in the commercial and recreational groundfish fisheries. In implementing these changes, NMFS inadvertently removed the trip limit for California black rockfish between 42[deg] N latitude and 40[deg]10' N latitude in Table 2 (North) and Table 3 (North). This correction is necessary so that the implementing regulations are accurate.

The National Marine Fisheries Service is correcting regulations published in a final rule on July 10, 2020, which reclassified sculpins as Ecosystem Component (EC) category, non-target species in both the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) (Amendment 121) and Gulf of Alaska (Amendment 110) Groundfish Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). In the implementing regulations, footnotes requiring the full retention of all rockfish species by catcher vessels (CVs) using hook- and-line, pot, or jig gear in the BSAI (Amendment 119) and Gulf of Alaska (Amendment 107) were unintentionally omitted from Tables 10 and 11 to 50 CFR part 679. This correcting amendment is therefore necessary to restore the footnotes as published in the final rule implementing Amendments 119 and 107 and to make other minor corrections.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) invites public comments about our intention to request approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for an extension of a currently approved information collection. Before a Federal agency may collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatements of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek OMB approval to allow NHTSA to continue to conduct research on the development of a driver alcohol detection system. NHTSA is seeking an extension of the information collection, titled "Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety Field Operational Test" (OMB Control Number 2127-0734), which is currently approved through March 31, 2022. The extension is necessary to complete data collection that was delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions. The burden hour and cost calculations have been adjusted to reflect only the remaining data collection, adjustments for recruitment based on current experience, and adjustments in participation based on current experience.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is revising the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards under the Clean Air Act section 202(a) for light-duty vehicles for 2023 and later model years to make the standards more stringent. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 13990 "Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle the Climate Crisis" directing EPA to consider whether to propose suspending, revising, or rescinding the standards previously revised under the "The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for Model Years 2021- 2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks," promulgated in April 2020. EPA is revising the GHG standards to be more stringent than the SAFE rule standards in each model year from 2023 through 2026. EPA is also including temporary targeted flexibilities to address the lead time of the final standards and to incentivize the production of vehicles with zero and near-zero emissions technology. In addition, EPA is making technical amendments to clarify and streamline our regulations.

Consequently, that revision resulted in needless repetition of "electronic reading room" in several part 801 regulations.

This rule rescinds the final rule published in the Federal Register on March 6, 2020, (2020 Form T-1 rule), which established the Form T-1, Trust Annual Report, required to be filed by labor organizations about certain trusts in which they are interested pursuant to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). Upon further review of the 2020 Form T-1 rule, including the pertinent facts and legally relevant policy considerations surrounding that rulemaking, the Department of Labor (Department) withdraws the rule implementing the Form T-1, because it has determined that the 2020 rulemaking record, particularly its analysis of the burden and the benefit of the rule, was insufficient as a matter of policy to justify the trust reporting requirements set forth in the 2020 Form T-1 rule. Further, by requiring reporting on entities not controlled or dominated by labor unions, the Department has determined that the trust reporting required under the rule is overly inclusive and is not necessary to prevent the circumvention and evasion of the Title II reporting requirements.

The special controls that apply to the device type are identified in this order and will be part of the codified language for the transcutaneous electrical continence device's classification. We are taking this action because we have determined that classifying the device into class II (special controls) will provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. We believe this action will also enhance patients' access to beneficial innovative devices.

NHTSA is issuing this final rule to establish Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 227, "Bus rollover structural integrity," to enhance the rollover structural integrity of over-the- road buses (motorcoaches), and other buses with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 11,793 kilograms (kg) (26,000 pounds (lb)). This final rule, issued pursuant to the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), requires the buses to provide a "survival space" in a rollover test to protect occupants from possible collapse of the bus structure around them. In addition, to reduce the likelihood of ejection, this final rule prohibits emergency exits from opening in the rollover test. This final rule ensures that bus roofs and side wall panels will resist deformation and intrusion into the occupant space in rollover crashes, and reduces the risk of emergency exits becoming ejection portals in a crash.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and requesting public comment on a draft revision to the risk determination for the Cyclic Aliphatic Bromide Cluster (HBCD) risk evaluation issued under TSCA. The draft revision to the HBCD risk determination was developed following a review of the first ten risk evaluations issued under TSCA that was done in accordance with Executive Orders and other Administration priorities, including those on environmental justice, scientific integrity, and regulatory review, and this draft revision reflects the announced policy changes to ensure the public is protected from unreasonable risks from chemicals in a way that is supported by science and the law. Specifically, in this draft revision to the risk determination EPA finds that HBCD, as a whole chemical substance, presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment when evaluated under its conditions of use. This draft revision supersedes the condition of use-specific no unreasonable risk determinations in the September 2020 HBCD risk evaluation (and withdraw the associated order) and makes a revised determination of unreasonable risk for HBCD as a whole chemical substance. In addition, this draft revised risk determination does not reflect an assumption that workers always appropriately wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Leonardo S.p.a. Model AW109SP helicopters. This AD was prompted by reports of an ineligible hydraulic pump being installed on Model AW109SP helicopters. This AD requires inspecting each hydraulic pump for damage and, depending on the inspections results, removing parts from service and accomplishing other corrective actions. This AD also requires removing certain parts from service before they exceed their life limits. The corrective actions are required to be accomplished as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This document contains proposed regulations providing that "minimum essential coverage," as that term is used in health insurance-related tax laws, does not include Medicaid coverage that is limited to COVID-19 testing and diagnostic services provided under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. The proposed regulations also would provide an automatic extension of time for providers of minimum essential coverage (including health insurance issuers, self-insured employers, and government agencies) to furnish individual statements regarding such coverage and would provide an alternative method for furnishing individual statements when the shared responsibility payment amount is zero. Additionally, the proposed regulations would provide an automatic extension of time for "applicable large employers" (generally employers with 50 or more full-time or full-time equivalent employees) to furnish statements relating to health insurance that the employer offers to its full-time employees. The proposed regulations would affect some taxpayers who claim the premium tax credit; health insurance issuers, self-insured employers, government agencies, and other persons that provide minimum essential coverage to individuals; and applicable large employers.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Model Ventus-2a and Ventus-2b gliders. This proposed AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as severe corrosion on the inboard flaperon actuation push rods and ball bearing connecting the flaperon push rod to the bell crank inside the wing. This proposed AD would require inspecting the affected parts of the flaperon control in the wings and taking corrective actions if necessary. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

AD 2015-16-07 R1 required inspecting the left-hand and right-hand rudder control pedal torque tubes and replacing with a serviceable part as necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2015-16-07 R1, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This AD retains the requirements of AD 2015-16-07 R1, expands the applicability, and requires repeating the inspections using updated procedures. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or we) is proposing to amend the agricultural water provisions of the produce safety regulation that covered farms have found complex and challenging to implement. This proposal would replace the microbial criteria and testing requirements for pre-harvest agricultural water for covered produce (other than sprouts) with provisions for systems-based agricultural water assessments that are designed to be more feasible to implement across the wide variety of agricultural water systems, uses, and practices, while also being adaptable to future advancements in agricultural water quality science and achieving improved public health protections. Additionally, we are proposing to require expedited mitigation for hazards related to certain activities associated with adjacent and nearby lands, in light of findings from several recent produce outbreak investigations. These proposed revisions to the produce safety regulation, if finalized, would more comprehensively address a known route of microbial contamination that can lead to preventable foodborne illness that is a significant public health problem.

The USGCRP is nearing the end of the implementation phase of its current plan, the National Global Change Research Plan 2012-2021; the Global Change Research Act calls for a 10- year plan with periodic updates. More detail on USGCRP strategic planning processes to date can be found here. The prospectus for the 2022-2031 Strategic Plan culminates an 8-month effort to solicit inputs from USGCRP member agencies, interagency working groups, and OSTP, as well as recommendations from external organizations such as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). The prospectus can be accessed for review, and comments may be submitted through the USGCRP Review and Comment (R&C) System.

This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regulations to reflect an extension and amendment of import restrictions on certain archaeological material and the imposition of import restrictions on ethnological material of the Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt). The restrictions on archaeological material, which were originally imposed by CBP Dec. 16-23, were extended and amended on November 30, 2021. The Acting Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending and updating the import restrictions that previously existed, and the Governments of the United States and Egypt entered into a new agreement to reflect the extension of these import restrictions. Additionally, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for adding import restrictions on certain categories of ethnological material. The new agreement, which entered into force on November 30, 2021, supersedes the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that became effective on November 30, 2016, and enabled the promulgation of the existing import restrictions. Accordingly, the current import restrictions and new import restrictions will be effective until November 30, 2026, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this extension and imposition. To fulfill the terms of the new MOU, the Designated List of cultural property, which was described in CBP Dec. 16-23, is amended in this document to reflect the addition and revision of categories of archaeological material of Egypt ranging in date from approximately 300,000 B.C. to A.D. 1750, and to include certain ethnological material ranging from A.D. 1517 to 1914.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, this notice announces the intention of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to request revision and extension of a currently approved information collection, the Agricultural Resources Management Survey (ARMS), phases 1 and 2 as well as Chemical Use Surveys.

The ARMS phase 3 and cooperator funded chemical use surveys will be moved to two new information collection requests. Splitting these surveys across multiple information collections will allow USDA and cooperators more flexibility for changes to best address current trends in the farming industry. A revision to burden hours will be needed due to this separation as well as changes in the size of the target population, sampling design, and/ or questionnaire length.

In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) proposes deregulatory amendments to the regulations to modernize and streamline the permit application for distilled spirits plants and for users and dealers of specially denatured alcohol and tax-free alcohol. The proposed amendments also relax some reporting requirements associated with changes to the business of those holding such permits and registrations. Some of these proposed liberalizing amendments would also apply to all Federal Alcohol Administration Act basic permit holders (including wineries, and importers and wholesalers of distilled spirits, wine, and malt beverages) and to alcohol beverage dealers. The proposed amendments are a result of TTB's evaluation of its permit and registration application requirements and consideration of relevant public comments submitted to the Treasury Department in response to its request for recommendations concerning regulations that can be eliminated, modified, or streamlined in order to reduce burdens. TTB believes the amendments proposed in this document will significantly reduce the time needed to complete an application for a permit or registration.

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service issued a final rule on December 31, 2012, to establish regulations under which research facilities and dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers must meet certain requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel. Implementation of the final rule was stayed on July 31, 2013, so that the agency could conduct additional review to further consider the impact of contingency plan requirements on regulated entities. Since that time, we have conducted such a review, and the 2021 Congressional Appropriations Act has required us to propose to lift the stay. We are therefore lifting the stay and making minor revisions to the requirements in order to update compliance dates and clarify intent. The lifting of the stay and proposed revisions will better ensure that entities responsible for animals regulated under the Animal Welfare Act are prepared to safeguard the health and welfare of such animals in the event of possible emergencies or disasters.

On October 8, 2021, India joined the United States and 134 other jurisdictions participating in the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in reaching a political agreement on a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the world economy. As part of Pillar 1, all parties agreed to remove existing Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) and other relevant similar measures, and to coordinate the withdrawal of these taxes. On November 24, 2021, India and the United States issued statements describing a transitional approach to India's DST prior to entry into force of Pillar 1. These statements reflect a political agreement that, in defined circumstances, the DST liability that U.S. companies accrue in India during the interim period will be creditable against future taxes accrued under Pillar 1 of the OECD agreement. Based on the commitment of India to remove its DST pursuant to Pillar 1 and on India's political agreement to this transitional approach prior to Pillar 1's entry into force, the U.S. Trade Representative has determined to terminate the section 301 action taken in the investigation of India's DST. In coordination with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), USTR will monitor implementation of the removal of India's DST as provided for under Pillar 1 and the transitional approach agreed to by India.

In 1990, Congress enacted statutory amendments to adjust the maximum civil penalty amounts authorized under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), and the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA). On August 14, 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) increased the maximum civil penalty amounts to $100,000 for each violation and $15,000,000 for any related series of violations. The CPSIA tied the effective date of the new amounts to the earlier of the date on which final regulations are issued or 1 year after August 14, 2008. The new amounts became effective on August 14, 2009. The CPSIA also revised the starting date, from December 1, 1994 to December 1, 2011, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year, thereafter, on which the Commission must prescribe and publish in the Federal Register, the schedule of maximum authorized penalties. On November 23, 2016, the CPSC published increased maximum authorized civil penalty amounts of $110,000 for each violation and $16,025,000 for any related series of violations. As calculated in accordance with the amendments, the new amounts are $120,000 for each violation and $17,150,000 for any related series of violations.

[FEDERAL REGISTER PAGE 20-40] 2021-12-01 00:00:00Z | Adverse Effect Wage Rate Methodology for the Temporary Employment of H-2A Nonimmigrants in Non-Range Occupations in the United States
Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/01/2021-25803/adverse-effect-wage-rate-methodology-for-the-temporary-employment-of-h-2a-nonimmigrants-in-non-range
The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is proposing to amend its regulations governing the certification of agricultural labor or services to be performed by temporary foreign workers in H-2A nonimmigrant status (H-2A workers). Specifically, the Department proposes to revise the methodology by which it determines the hourly Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) for non-range occupations (i.e., all occupations other than herding and production of livestock on the range) using a combination of wage data reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Labor Survey (FLS) and the Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey, formerly the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey prior to March 31, 2021. For the vast majority of H-2A job opportunities represented by six occupations comprising the field and livestock worker (combined) wages reported by USDA, the proposed regulations will rely on the FLS to establish the AEWRs for these occupations in accordance with the methodology used by the Department for nearly all of the last 30 years. For all other occupations and to address circumstances in which the FLS does not report wage data for the field and livestock worker occupations, the Department proposes to use the OEWS survey to establish the AEWRs for each occupation. These proposed regulations are consistent with the Secretary of Labor's (Secretary) statutory responsibility to certify that the employment of H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. The Department believes the proposed methodology will strike a reasonable balance between the statute's competing goals of providing employers with an adequate legal supply of agricultural labor and protecting the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.

On October 8, 2021, Turkey joined the United States and 134 other jurisdictions participating in the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in reaching a political agreement on a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the world economy. As part of Pillar 1, all parties agreed to remove existing digital services taxes and other relevant similar measures, and to coordinate the withdrawal of these taxes. On November 22, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) issued a joint statement with Turkey regarding a transitional approach to Turkey's Digital Service Tax (DST) prior to entry into force of Pillar 1. The joint statement reflects a political agreement that DST liabilities accrued during the transitional period will be creditable in defined circumstances against future taxes due under Pillar 1. Based on the commitment of Turkey to remove its DST pursuant to Pillar 1 and on Turkey's political agreement to the transitional approach prior to Pillar 1's entry into force, the U.S. Trade Representative has determined to terminate the section 301 action taken in the investigation of Turkey's DST. In coordination with Treasury, USTR will monitor implementation of the removal of Turkey's DST as provided for under Pillar 1 and the transitional approach as provided in the joint statement.

The Coast Guard is issuing regulations to expand vessel financial responsibility to apply to all tank vessels greater than 100 gross tons as required by statute, and to make other amendments that clarify and update reporting requirements, reflect current practice, and remove unnecessary regulations. These regulations ensure that the Coast Guard has current information when there are significant changes in a vessel's operation, ownership, or evidence of financial responsibility, and reflects current best practices in the Coast Guard's management of the Certificate of Financial Responsibility program.

The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), requests information on how to site Federal facilities for the temporary, consolidated storage of spent nuclear fuel using a consent- based approach. DOE anticipates that communities; governments at the local, State, and Tribal levels; members of the public; energy and environmental justice groups; organizations or corporations; and other stakeholders may be interested in responding to this Request for Information (RFI). We especially welcome insight from people, communities, and groups that have historically not been well- represented in these discussions. Responses to the RFI will inform development of a consent-based siting process, overall strategy for an integrated waste management system, and possibly a funding opportunity.

The National Indian Gaming Commission proposes to amend our facility license notifications. The proposed rule would modify the requirement that facility license notice submissions include a name and address of the proposed gaming facility. Specifically, the National Indian Gaming Commission would require the submission of the name and address of the property only if known when the facility license notification is submitted to the NIGC Chair. The Commission proposes this action to assist tribal governments, and tribal gaming regulatory authorities that face challenges in meeting the regulatory requirement in instances where a facility has not been issued a name or address.

On October 21, 2011, the Plaintiffs Sierra Club and Center for Environmental Law and Policy filed a complaint alleging, among other things, that EPA failed to perform duties mandated by the Clean Water Act ("CWA") with respect to Total Maximum Daily Loads ("TMDLs") for segments of the Spokane River and adjacent water bodies that were listed as impaired due to polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs"). EPA seeks public input on the proposed consent decree prior to its final decision-making to settle the litigation.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for DG Flugzeugbau GmbH Model DG-1000T gliders and Schempp-Hirth Flugzeugbau GmbH Model Duo Discus T gliders with a Solo Kleinmotoren GmbH Solo Model 2350C or 2350D engine installed. This proposed AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) issued by the aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI describes the unsafe condition as failure of the bearing of the upper pulley of the belt driven reduction gear resulting in separation of the propeller from the engine. This proposed AD would require replacing a certain hex-nut and would establish a lift limit for the ball bearing assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is conducting the 26th administrative review of the antidumping duty order on fresh garlic from the People's Republic of China (China). The period of review (POR) for the administrative review is November 1, 2019, through October 31, 2020. Commerce preliminarily determines that the only mandatory respondent for which a request for review remains, Jining Shunchang Import & Export Co., Ltd. (Shunchang), failed to establish its eligibility for a separate rate and therefore is part of the China-wide entity. We also preliminarily find that the review request made by The Roots Farm Inc. (Roots Farm) was not valid, and accordingly, because it was the sole remaining request for the other mandatory respondent, Zhengzhou Harmoni Spice Co., Ltd. (Harmoni), we have preliminarily rescinded the review with respect to Harmoni. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.

The OCC, the Board, and the Bureau are finalizing amendments to the official interpretations for their regulations that implement section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Section 129H of TILA establishes special appraisal requirements for ``higher-risk mortgages,'' termed ``higher-priced mortgage loans'' or ``HPMLs'' in the agencies' regulations. The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) jointly issued final rules implementing these requirements, effective January 18, 2014. The Agencies' rules exempted, among other loan types, transactions of $25,000 or less, and required that this loan amount be adjusted annually based on any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the CPI-W in effect as of June 1, 2021, the exemption threshold will increase from $27,200 to $28,500, effective January 1, 2022.

NMFS is closing the Atlantic herring fishery and implementing a 2,000-lb (907.2-kg) possession limit for herring in all Herring Management Areas. This is required because NMFS projects that herring catch will reach 95 percent of the annual catch limit before the end of the fishing year. This action is intended to prevent overharvest of herring, which would result in additional catch limit reductions in a subsequent year.

The Board and the Bureau are publishing final rules amending the official interpretations and commentary for the agencies' regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended TILA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions be adjusted annually by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Under regulations adopted by the Board and the Bureau, if there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Board and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2021, the exemption threshold will increase from $58,300 to $61,000 effective January 1, 2022. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Consumer Leasing Act's threshold for exempt consumer leases, the Board and the Bureau are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Consumer Leasing Act elsewhere in the Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has prepared a draft management plan as part of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS or sanctuary) management plan review pursuant to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. The draft management plan, which would update the 2010 sanctuary management plan, addresses current and emerging threats in SBNMS and reflects changes in new science and technologies, how people use the sanctuary, and community needs. The draft management plan supports continued protection of sanctuary resources through enforcement of existing sanctuary regulations, education and outreach strategies that promote ocean stewardship, and community engagement. Consistent with the information provided in the 2020 Notice of Intent, NOAA is not proposing modifications to the sanctuary regulations at this time, but may consider regulatory changes in the future. NOAA also prepared an environmental assessment, which evaluates the environmental impacts of implementing the draft management plan and ongoing field activities. NOAA is soliciting public comments on the draft updated management plan and environmental assessment at this time.

This final action revises the initial air quality designations for two counties associated with two nonattainment areas for the 2015 primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone. In a July 10, 2020, decision, the District of Columbia Circuit Court remanded to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency), but did not vacate, the April 30, 2018, designations for 16 counties associated with nine nonattainment areas located in seven states. In response, the EPA has re-evaluated the designations for the remanded counties by applying a uniform, nationwide analytical approach and interpretation of the designation provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA) in considering the specific facts and circumstances of the areas using only data and information available at the time of the original designations. In this final action, the EPA is revising the boundaries of two nonattainment areas, affecting the designation status of two counties in two separate states (Colorado and Texas). The EPA addressed the 14 additional remanded counties in a previous Federal Register document.

The Board and the Bureau are finalizing amendments to the official interpretations and commentary for the agencies' regulations that implement the Consumer Leasing Act (CLA). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended the CLA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer leases be adjusted annually by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Under regulations adopted by the Board and the Bureau, if there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Board and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2021, the exemption threshold will increase from $58,300 to $61,000 effective January 1, 2022. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Truth in Lending Act's threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions, the Board and the Bureau are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act elsewhere in the Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register.

Following receipt on October 14, 2021 of a request from the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the U.S. International Trade Commission (Commission) instituted Investigation No. 332-587, Distributional Effects of Trade and Trade Policy on U.S. Workers, for the purpose of conducting a two- part investigation, with the Commission in part one to provide a public report that catalogues information on the distributional effects on under-represented and under-served communities of trade and trade policy, and with the Commission in part two to expand its research and analysis capabilities so that future probable economic effects advice includes estimates of the potential distributional effects of trade and trade policy, including goods and services imports, on U.S. workers. In preparing its public report, the USTR asked the Commission to gather information through roundtable discussions among representatives of under-represented and under-served communities, and through a symposium focused on academic or similar research on the distributional effects on under-represented and under-served communities of trade and trade policy. The Commission will also hold a public hearing following the roundtables and symposium. The Commission will issue a second notice, to be published in the Federal Register by January 31, 2022 that sets out the format and dates for the roundtables, symposium, and hearing, and how members of the public may participate in them.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to partially approve and partially disapprove a revision to the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) intended to provide for attaining the 2010 primary, health-based 1-hour sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or ``standard'') for the Muskingum River SO<INF>2</INF> nonattainment area. This SIP revision (hereinafter referred to as Ohio's Muskingum River SO<INF>2</INF> attainment plan or plan) includes Ohio's attainment demonstration and other attainment planning elements required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). EPA is proposing to approve the base year emissions inventory and affirm that the nonattainment new source review requirements for the area have been met. EPA is proposing to disapprove the attainment plan, since the plan relies on, among other things, acquisition of a parcel of land by a facility, Globe Metallurgical (Globe), located within the nonattainment area. Globe has recently indicated to EPA and Ohio EPA that it will not be purchasing that parcel of land. Additionally, EPA is proposing to disapprove the plan for failing to meet the requirements for meeting reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment of the NAAQS, reasonably available control measures/reasonably available control technology (RACM/RACT), emission limitations and control measures as necessary to attain the NAAQS, and contingency measures. Based on the change in circumstances since the original proposed action, EPA is now proposing a changed course of action.

This action modifies the Class D airspace, Class E surface airspace, and Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Tacoma Narrows Airport, Tacoma, WA. A review of the airspace was initiated due to corresponding reviews at McChord Field (Joint Base Lewis-McChord) and Gray AAF (Joint Base Lewis- McChord). All three locations were evaluated at the same time due to their close proximity to one another and operational interdependence. After a review of the airspace, the FAA found it necessary to modify the existing airspace for the safety and management of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at this airport.

The recently enacted Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests in the deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure as one of many important ways to confront the climate crisis. Through a National Electric Vehicle Formula Program (EV Charging Program), the law provides funding to States to strategically deploy EV charging infrastructure and to establish an interconnected network to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability. The law also establishes a discretionary grant program for Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program) to strategically deploy publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure and hydrogen, propane, and natural gas fueling infrastructure along designated alternative fuel corridors or in certain other locations that are accessible to all drivers of such vehicles. The law directs DOT, in coordination or consultation with the Department of Energy (DOE), to develop guidance for both programs. Through this notice, FHWA invites public comments to inform the development of the guidance. FHWA is especially interested in comments suggesting ways that the guidance could promote equity in the deployment of EV charging infrastructure under these programs.

We are proposing to amend the regulations for the importation of equines. These changes include increasing the number of days horses exported from regions free from contagious equine metritis (CEM) are allowed to spend in a CEM-affected region and re-enter the United States without testing from 60 days to 90 days; requiring an import permit for horses transiting through CEM-affected regions; adding requirements for health certifications to ensure health certifications properly attest to the health of the imported horse; removing the requirement that horses permanently imported from Canada undergo inspection at the port of entry; requiring that horses transiting Central America or the West Indies comply with the same regulations that apply to horses directly imported from these regions; and adding requirements for shipping containers used in transporting horses. We are also proposing a number of miscellaneous changes to the regulations such as clarifications of existing policy or intent, and corrections of inconsistencies or outdated information. Many of these proposed changes would better align our regulations with international standards and allow us and the equine industry more flexibility. The proposed changes would also add further safeguards that protect against introducing or disseminating pests or diseases of livestock into the United States.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The FAA Regional Administrators' Offices and the FAA Noise Ombudsman will use the information voluntarily reported, on the occasion of a complaint, by the public in the FAA Noise Portal to prepare responses to their noise complaints or inquiries. The required FAA Noise Portal fields represent the minimum amount of information the FAA needs to address the public's noise complaint or question and includes: Name, email, address or cross street and a description of the noise complaint or inquiry. It is important to know the person's name and email address to respond and track the complaint. The FAA will not respond to the same complaint from the same person more than once. The address or cross street is needed for the FAA to determine potential sources of the aircraft noise issues as most people complain about aircraft in the vicinity of their residence. The description is used to provide additional details for the FAA to better address the complaint or question.

The FDIC seeks to continue its engagement and collaboration with innovators in the financial, non-financial, and technology sectors to, among other things, identify, develop and promote technology-driven innovations among community and other banks in a manner that ensures the safety and soundness of FDIC-supervised and -insured institutions. An innovation pilot program framework can provide a regulatory environment in which the FDIC, in conjunction with individual proposals collected from innovators, including banks, will provide tailored regulatory and supervisory assistance, when appropriate, to facilitate the testing of innovative and advanced technologies, products, services, systems, or activities. As part of an innovation pilot program, innovators may request information from banks and other members of the public outside of their normal course of business. Any information provided by banks and other members of the public will be provided on a voluntary basis. FDIC staff may similarly request information on a voluntary basis from banks or other members of the public to evaluate the products or services developed in the pilot programs. The FDIC invites the general public, including persons who may have an interest in participating in innovation pilot programs, and other Federal agencies to comment on the agency's collection of information that may result from innovators obtaining information from banks and other members of the public in connection with innovation pilot programs, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. On September 22, 2021 and September 28, 2021, the FDIC published notices in the Federal Register requesting comment for 60 days on a proposal to amend this information collection. One comment was received but did not indicate any changes to be made to the information collection.

This exemption allows SNC to implement these requirements for each unit after the Commission finds that the acceptance criteria in the COL are met for the unit and prior to that unit's initial fuel load into the reactor.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of South Carolina, through the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), via a letter dated July 7, 2020. The SIP revision includes the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the Catawba Indian Nation portion (hereinafter referred to as the Catawba Area) of the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill NC-SC 1997 8-hour ozone maintenance area (hereinafter referred to as the Charlotte NC-SC 1997 8-hour NAAQS Area). The Charlotte NC-SC 1997 8-hour NAAQS Area is comprised of Cabarrus, Gaston, Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Rowan, Union and a portion of Iredell County (i.e., Davidson and Coddle Creek Townships) in North Carolina and a portion of York County, South Carolina which includes the Catawba Area. EPA is proposing to approve the Catawba Area LMP because it provides for the maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS within the Catawba Area through the end of the second 10-year portion of the maintenance period. The effect of this action would be to make certain commitments related to maintenance of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS in the Catawba Area federally enforceable as part of the South Carolina SIP.

Specifically, the EPA is approving all but the contingency measure element of the submitted ``Moderate'' area plan for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, as updated by the submitted ``Serious'' area plan and related supplement to the State strategy, as meeting all applicable Moderate area plan requirements for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. In addition, the EPA is approving 2022 motor vehicle emissions budgets for use in transportation conformity analyses for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The EPA is disapproving the contingency measure element with respect to the Moderate area requirements for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The EPA is also reclassifying the SJV PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment area, including reservation areas of Indian country and any other area of Indian country within it where the EPA or a tribe has demonstrated that the tribe has jurisdiction, as a Serious nonattainment area for the 2012 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS based on the EPA's determination that the area cannot practicably attain the standard by the applicable Moderate area attainment date of December 31, 2021. As a consequence of this reclassification, California is required to submit a Serious area plan for the area that includes a demonstration of attainment by the applicable Serious area attainment date, which is no later than December 31, 2025, or by the most expeditious alternative date practicable. However, we note that California has already submitted such Serious area plan, which the EPA will address in a separate rulemaking. Lastly, the EPA is disapproving the contingency measure element in the Serious area plan for the 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS.

To implement provisions of Executive Order 14034, ``Protecting Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries'' (E.O. 14034), the Department of Commerce is proposing to amend its Interim Final Rule on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain (Supply Chain Rule), which was published on January 19, 2021, 86 FR 4909. Specifically, this proposed rule would amend the Supply Chain Rule to provide for additional criteria that the Secretary of Commerce (the Secretary) may consider specifically when determining whether ICTS Transactions (as defined in the Supply Chain Rule) that involve connected software applications present an undue or unacceptable risk. The rule also makes conforming changes by revising the definition of ICTS to expressly include ``connected software applications'' and adding a definition of ``connected software application'' that is consistent with that used in E.O. 14034. The Department is interested in the public's views on the additional criteria for connected software applications, including whether they should be applied to all ICTS Transaction reviews, whether there are other criteria that should be applied, and how the Secretary should apply the criteria to ICTS Transactions involving connected software applications.

This notice announces that the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) is suspending certain regulatory requirements for F-1 nonimmigrant students who are Hong Kong residents (regardless of country of birth) and who are experiencing severe economic hardship as a direct result of the emergent circumstances in Hong Kong. The Secretary is taking action to provide relief to Hong Kong residents \1\ who are lawful F-1 nonimmigrant students so the students may request employment authorization, work an increased number of hours while school is in session, and reduce their course load while continuing to maintain F-1 nonimmigrant student status. DHS will deem an F-1 nonimmigrant student who receives employment authorization by means of this notice to be engaged in a ``full course of study'' for the duration of the employment authorization, if the nonimmigrant student satisfies the minimum course load requirement described in this notice. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EPA is proposing significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) and are also subject to Orders issued by EPA pursuant to TSCA. The SNURs require persons who intend to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) or process any of these chemical substances for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the use, under the conditions of use for that chemical substance, within the applicable review period. Persons may not commence manufacture or processing for the significant new use until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and has taken such actions as are required by that determination.

This document finalizes regulations to implement an Executive order titled "Increasing the Minimum Wage for Federal Contractors," which was signed by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. on April 27, 2021. The Executive order states the Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are promoted when the Federal Government contracts with sources that adequately compensate their workers. The Executive order therefore seeks to raise the hourly minimum wage paid by those contractors to workers performing work on or in connection with covered Federal contracts to $15.00 per hour, beginning January 30, 2022; and beginning January 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). The Executive order directs the Secretary to issue regulations by November 24, 2021, consistent with applicable law, to implement the order's requirements. This final rule therefore establishes standards and procedures for implementing and enforcing the minimum wage protections of the Executive order. As required by the order, the final rule incorporates to the extent practicable existing definitions, principles, procedures, remedies, and enforcement processes under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Service Contract Act, the Davis- Bacon Act, and the Executive order of February 12, 2014, entitled "Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors," as well as the regulations issued to implement that order.

Version 2.0 updates the model from Version 1.1, released in 2014, and includes a variety of updates to the model domains and practices to better address emerging technologies and the evolving cyber threat landscape. Since the release in July, DOE has piloted the updated model with energy companies and utilities.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is proposing to reclassify human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load monitoring tests, a postamendments class III device with the product code MZF, into class II (special controls), subject to premarket notification. FDA is also proposing a new device classification regulation along with special controls that the Agency believes are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for this device type. FDA is proposing this reclassification on its own initiative. If finalized, this order will reclassify this device type from class III (premarket approval) to class II (special controls) and reduce the regulatory burdens associated with these devices because manufacturers will no longer be required to submit a premarket approval application (PMA) for this device type but can instead submit a less burdensome premarket notification (510(k)) and receive clearance before marketing their device.

We are amending the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations governing facilities that conduct research, experimentation, teaching, and testing by removing duplicative and unnecessary reviews and requests for information. We are removing the requirement that registered research facilities update their registration information every 3 years because the information is already collected by other means. We are also removing a redundant requirement for the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at each facility to conduct a continuing review of research activities involving animals and instead requiring a complete resubmission and review of such activities at least every 3 years. We will also no longer require that research facilities request an inactive status if they no longer use, handle, or transport AWA covered animals. In addition, we are clarifying the duration of a registration and conditions for its cancellation and will no longer require that the Institutional Official or Chief Executive Officer sign the annual report. We are also making miscellaneous changes to improve readability. These changes will reduce duplicative requirements and administrative burden on facilities while continuing to ensure the integrity and credibility of research findings and the protection of research animals.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This AD was prompted by a report of cracking in certain components on left and right sides of the aft wing-to-body fairing (WTBF) structure near the tie-rod attachment at a certain fuselage station; this cracking likely resulted from excessive tie-rod preload. This AD requires inspecting the aft WTBF structure for any cracking or damage, adjusting the load on the two tie-rods at a certain fuselage station, and repair if necessary, as specified in two Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) ADs, which are incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The U.S. Department of Energy (``DOE'') proposes to amend the test procedures for battery chargers to improve test procedure representativeness. The proposal would: Establish a new appendix Y1 that would expand coverage of inductive wireless battery chargers and establish associated definitions and test provisions; establish a new test procedure approach that relies on separate metrics for active mode, stand-by, and off-mode (consequently removing the battery charger usage profiles and unit energy consumption calculation); and update the wall adapter selection criteria. DOE also proposes changes to appendix Y to reorganize two subsections, to clarify symbology and references, to correct an incorrect cross reference and section title, to update the list of battery chemistries, and to terminate an existing test procedure waiver because the covered subject models have been discontinued. DOE further proposes to mirror these changes in the newly proposed appendix Y1. DOE is seeking comment from interested parties on the proposals.

AD 2011-07-02 required initial and repetitive torque inspections of the 3rd-stage and 4th-stage low- pressure turbine (LPT) blades. AD 2011-07-02 also required replacement of the LPT blade if wear limits are exceeded, replacement of the LPT- to-exhaust case bolts and nuts, and installation of crushable sleeve spacers on the bolts. This AD was prompted by a report of an MD-82 airplane, equipped with a JT8D-217C model turbofan engine, experiencing an engine surge that resulted in the fracture of the LPT blade and uncontained release of the LPT blade. This AD retains certain requirements of AD 2011-07-02, while revising the inspection thresholds and replacement intervals for the 3rd-stage and 4th-stage LPT blades. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This document sets forth interim final rules implementing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), as enacted by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA). These provisions are applicable to group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage. These interim final rules add provisions to existing rules under the Code, ERISA, and the PHS Act. These interim final rules implement provisions of the Code, ERISA, and PHS Act that increase transparency by requiring group health plans and health insurance issuers in the group and individual markets to submit certain information about prescription drugs and health care spending to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of the Treasury (collectively, the Departments). The Departments are issuing these interim final rules with largely parallel provisions that apply to group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also issuing interim final rules that require Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) carriers to report information about prescription drugs and health care spending in the same manner as a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage.

The OCC, Board, and FDIC are issuing a final rule that requires a banking organization to notify its primary Federal regulator of any ``computer-security incident'' that rises to the level of a ``notification incident,'' as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that a notification incident has occurred. The final rule also requires a bank service provider to notify each affected banking organization customer as soon as possible when the bank service provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause, a material service disruption or degradation for four or more hours.

Source: Federal Register

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (``EPCA''), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products, including direct heating equipment (``DHE''). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy (``DOE'') to periodically determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. After carefully considering the available market and technical information for these products, DOE has concluded in this document that the technology options, product cost, and energy use have not changed significantly, and that the market for DHE (i.e., number of models available and annual shipments) has decreased since DOE's prior determination that the energy conservation standards do not need to be amended. As such, DOE has determined that amended energy conservation standards are not warranted.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce our 12-month findings for two freshwater turtle species, the Pascagoula map turtle (Graptemys gibbonsi) and the Pearl River map turtle (Graptemys pearlensis), as endangered or threatened species. The Pascagoula map turtle is endemic to the Pascagoula River drainage in Mississippi, and the Pearl River map turtle is endemic to the Pearl River drainage in Mississippi and Louisiana. We propose to list the Pearl River map turtle as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act (``4(d) rule''). After a thorough review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that it is not warranted at this time to list the Pascagoula map turtle; however, we propose to list the Pascagoula map turtle along with Alabama map turtle (Graptemys pulchra), Barbour's map turtle (Graptemys barbouri), and Escambia map turtle (Graptemys ernsti) as threatened species due to similarity of appearance to the Pearl River map turtle with a 4(d) rule. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add the Pearl River map turtle, Alabama map turtle, Barbour's map turtle, Escambia map turtle, and Pascagoula map turtle to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.

On January 20, 2021, President Biden ordered all executive departments and agencies to immediately review and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, take action to address the promulgation of Federal regulations during the last 4 years that may conflict with protecting the environment, and to immediately commence work to confront the climate crisis (Executive Order 13990). In addition, on January 26, 2021, President Biden directed all Federal agencies to review tribal consultation policies and practices and recommit to more robust nation-to-nation relationships and respect for our Federal trust responsibilities. Consistent with these Presidential directives, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA or Department), proposes to repeal a final rule promulgated in 2020 that exempted the Tongass National Forest (Tongass or the Forest) from the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (2001 Roadless Rule). The 2001 Roadless Rule prohibited timber harvest and road construction or reconstruction within designated Inventoried Roadless Areas, with limited exceptions. Repealing the Subpart E exemption would reinstate application of the 2001 Roadless Rule to the Tongass (as provided for in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska's Judgment in Organized Village of Kake v. USDA. USDA invites written comments on the proposed rule and associated documents. Substantive comments received during the comment period will be considered in developing the final rule.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/22/2021-25367/establish-national-minimum-insurance-standard-for-national-marine-fisheries-service-programs-that
NMFS is proposing to establish a uniform, nationally consistent minimum insurance standard that would apply in regional regulatory programs that authorize an observer provider to deploy a person in any mandatory or voluntary observer program and that specify responsibilities of authorized providers. NMFS has concluded that this action is necessary to clarify the types of insurance that are appropriate to address the financial risks that observer coverage presents in any federally managed fishery that is subject to observer coverage. The proposed standard would establish a nationally consistent suite of insurance coverages that an observer provider seeking authorization, or that has been authorized, must have to mitigate the financial risks associated with providing observer services; specifically observer deployments to fishing vessels or shoreside locations such as processing facilities, and those that arise with training personnel for these deployments. Through compliance with this minimum standard, observer providers would be properly insured, thereby mitigating the financial risks that fishing vessels, first receivers, and shoreside processors have when complying with observer coverage requirements. This proposed rule would also revise regional observer program regulations to reference the newly established national minimum insurance standard, but existing regional observer program regulatory procedures that specify how an observer provider demonstrates compliance with insurance requirements would not be modified.

This final rule amends the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Regulations to reflect an extension and amendment of import restrictions on certain archaeological and ecclesiastical ethnological material of the Hellenic Republic (Greece). The restrictions, which were originally imposed by CBP Dec. 11-25 and last extended in CBP Dec. 16-21, are due to expire on November 21, 2021. The Acting Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cultural Affairs, United States Department of State, has made the requisite determinations for extending the import restrictions that previously existed, and the Government of the United States and the Government of Greece entered into a new agreement to reflect the extension of these import restrictions. The new agreement, which enters into force on November 21, 2021, supersedes the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that became effective on November 21, 2016, and enabled the promulgation of the existing import restrictions. Accordingly, the import restrictions will remain in effect for an additional five years, and the CBP regulations are being amended to reflect this extension until November 21, 2026. To fulfill the terms of the new MOU, the Designated List of cultural property, which was described in CBP Dec. 11-25, is amended in this document to correct certain typographical errors, to add certain coins from the Byzantine and Medieval periods, to clarify pottery styles, and to include post-Byzantine ethnological material dating up to A.D. 1830.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is issuing a final order to reclassify three types of blood lancets used to puncture skin to obtain a drop of blood for diagnostic purposes from class I (general controls) exempt from premarket notification into class II (special controls) and subject to premarket notification, specifically, single use only blood lancets with an integral sharps injury prevention feature, single use only blood lancets without an integral sharps injury prevention feature, and multiple use blood lancets for single patient use only. FDA is designating special controls for these three types of blood lancets based on the determination that general controls only are not sufficient and there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide a reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. FDA is also reclassifying a fourth type of blood lancet, multiple use blood lancets for multiple patient use, from class I (general controls) exempt from premarket notification into class III (premarket approval). FDA is reclassifying these four types of blood lancets on its own initiative based on new information.

NMFS is implementing allowable catch levels including an overfishing limit, an allowable biological catch, and an annual catch limit for Pacific mackerel in the U.S. exclusive economic zone off the West Coast (California, Oregon and Washington) for the fishing seasons 2021-2022 and 2022-2023. This rule is finalized pursuant to the Coastal Pelagic Species Fishery Management Plan. The harvest guideline and annual catch target for the 2021-2022 fishing season are 8,323 metric tons (mt) and 7,323 mt, respectively. The harvest guideline and annual catch target for the 2022-2023 fishing season are 5,822 mt and 4,822 mt, respectively. If the fishery attains the annual catch target in either fishing season, the directed fishery will close, reserving the 1,000-mt difference between the harvest guideline and annual catch target as a set-aside for incidental landings and other sources of mortality. This rule is intended to conserve and manage the Pacific mackerel stock off the U.S. West Coast.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-15-51, which applies to Bell Textron Inc. (type certificate previously held by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.) Model 204B, 205A, 205A-1, 205B, and 212 helicopters. AD 2021-15-51 requires removing certain main rotor hub strap pins (pin) from service and prohibits installing them on any helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-15-51, it was determined that a defective pin could also be installed on Bell Textron Inc. Model 210 helicopters. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2021-15-51 and expand the applicability to add Model 210 helicopters. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This action finalizes the residual risk and technology review (RTR) conducted for the Refractory Products Manufacturing source category regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found the risks due to emissions of air toxics from this source category to be acceptable and that the standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health. As a result, the Agency is making no revisions to the emission limits for this source category based on the residual risk. In our technology review, after reviewing developments in practices, processes, and control technologies, the EPA determined that no revisions to the numeric emission limits is necessary. However, the EPA is revising certain work practice provisions based on the technology review. These final amendments also include new provisions for certain hazardous air pollutants (HAP) and a revision of the alternative fuel provisions. In addition, the Agency is taking final action on the proposed amendments for the source category to address emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM); emissions during periods of scheduled maintenance; electronic reporting of notification of compliance status (NOCS) reports, performance test results, and performance evaluation results; the addition of test methods and guidance materials; updates to several test methods; and other miscellaneous clarifying and technical corrections.

NMFS announces its request for applications for the 2022 shark research fishery from commercial shark fishermen with directed or incidental shark limited access permits. The shark research fishery allows for the collection of fishery-dependent and biological data for future stock assessments and to meet the research objectives of the Agency. The only commercial vessels authorized to land sandbar sharks are those participating in the shark research fishery. Shark research fishery permittees may also land other large coastal sharks (LCS), small coastal sharks (SCS), smoothhound, and pelagic sharks. Commercial shark fishermen who are interested in participating in the shark research fishery need to submit a completed Shark Research Fishery Permit Application to be considered.

This action finalizes the residual risk and technology review (RTR) conducted for the Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication Operations source category regulated under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). This action also finalizes the NESHAP technology review for two area source categories, Flexible Polyurethane Foam Production and Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication, which are combined in one subpart. In this action, the EPA is finalizing the proposed revisions to the Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication Operations major source NESHAP, which include adding a numeric emission limit for existing flame lamination units, removing exemptions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) and specifying that the emissions standards always apply, requiring periodic performance tests, and requiring electronic reporting of performance test results and compliance reports. In this action, the EPA is also finalizing the proposed revisions to the NESHAP for Flexible Polyurethane Foam Production and Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication area sources to remove references to the provisions of another NESHAP that has been revised and no longer contains the referenced provisions. Implementation of these final rules is not expected to result in significant changes to the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from affected facilities in these three source categories or to human health impacts or environmental impacts associated with those emissions. However, this action will result in improved monitoring, compliance, and implementation of the existing standards and codifies existing industry practices to prevent backsliding.

On October 8, 2021, Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom joined the United States and 130 other jurisdictions participating in the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in reaching a political agreement on a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the world economy. As part of Pillar 1, all parties agreed to remove existing Digital Services Taxes (DSTs) and other relevant similar measures, and to coordinate the withdrawal of these taxes. On October 21, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) issued a joint statement with Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom on a transitional approach to those countries' DSTs prior to entry into force of Pillar 1. The joint statement reflects a political agreement that DST liabilities accrued during the transitional period will be creditable in defined circumstances against future income taxes due under Pillar 1. Based on the commitments of Austria, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom to remove their DSTs pursuant to Pillar 1 and on their political agreement to the transitional approach prior to Pillar 1's entry into force, the U.S. Trade Representative has determined to terminate the section 301 actions taken in the respective investigations of these countries' DSTs. In coordination with Treasury, USTR will monitor implementation of the removal of these countries' DSTs as provided for under Pillar 1 and the transitional approach as provided in the joint statement.

The submission also contains updates to improve the clarity of the language and align with the statewide solid fuel burning device regulations already applicable in YRCAA's jurisdiction.

FMCSA announces that the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) has requested an exemption from the Entry-Level Driver Training (ELDT) requirements that will be implemented in February 2022. The exemption request applies to drivers, trained through ODE's "Pre-Service School Bus Driver Training" curriculum, who are seeking to obtain their Class B Commercial Driver's License (CDL) with school bus (S) and passenger (P) endorsements, and to current Class B CDL holders wishing to add the P and S endorsements. The ODE believes the Ohio theory (i.e., classroom) curriculum and behind-the-wheel (BTW) instruction meet or exceeds all the new ELDT requirements.

The New England Fishery Management Council initiated development of Amendment 5 to the Northeast Skate Complex Fishery Management Plan in 2016. A notice of intent to develop an environmental impact statement for this action was published in January 2017, followed by a second notice and round of scoping in late December 2020. However, in September 2021, the Council voted to discontinue work on Amendment 5 and pursue the remaining alternatives through newly initiated Framework Adjustment 9. The remaining alternatives in this framework are largely administrative and not expected to have significant impacts on the fishery or human environment. Therefore, NMFS is withdrawing the notice of intent and no longer intends to prepare an environmental impact statement.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove the Okaloosa darter (Etheostoma okaloosae) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List) due to recovery. Our review of the best available scientific and commercial data indicates that the threats to the species have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). We request information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule and the draft post-delisting monitoring (PDM) plan for Okaloosa darters. If this proposal is finalized, Okaloosa darters will be removed from the List and the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, would no longer apply to the species.

EPA is proposing significant new use rules (SNURs) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemical substances that were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs). The chemical substances received "not likely to present an unreasonable risk" determinations pursuant to TSCA. The SNURs require persons who intend to manufacture (defined by statute to include import) or process any of these chemical substances for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity. The required notification initiates EPA's evaluation of the use, under the conditions of use for that chemical substance, within the applicable review period. Persons may not commence manufacture or processing for the significant new use until EPA has conducted a review of the notice, made an appropriate determination on the notice, and has taken such actions as are required by that determination.

To establish entitlement to a survivor annuity or basic employee death benefit ("BEDB") under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), a "widow" or "widower" must have been married to a federal employee or annuitant for at least 9 months immediately before the employee or annuitant's death. Same-sex spouses of deceased federal employees or annuitants whose spouse died prior to the time the 9-month marriage requirement could be satisfied may have been prevented or frustrated from satisfying this eligibility requirement as a result of provisions enacted under the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) or state laws prohibiting same sex marriages, now understood to have been unconstitutional. Therefore, this notice provides information about when, and under what circumstances, OPM will deem the 9-month marriage requirement satisfied, notwithstanding the actual duration of the marriage, to provide affected applicants with benefits they could have obtained had they been permitted to marry earlier in their states of residence.

Source: Federal Register

This notice is to inform the public that the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to award $152,000,000 (total costs) for up to two years to Vibrant Emotional Health for the 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Expansion for Behavioral Health Crisis Response (Lifeline Expansion). Under this cooperative agreement, Vibrant Emotional Health will improve and expand the national Lifeline backup centers, text/chat centers, and Spanish language crisis centers to: (1) Respond, intervene, and provide follow- up to individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis by recruiting and training additional behavioral health staff; (2) support and expand services for populations at high risk of suicide; and (3) develop the infrastructure needed to meet the increased service demand requirements anticipated with the FCC's national launch of 988 in July 2022. It is expected that this program will: (1) Increase response rates for national Lifeline backup centers, text/chat centers, and Spanish language crisis centers; (2) increase the workforce capacity of the national Lifeline backup centers, text/chat centers, and Spanish language crisis centers; and (3) improve the oversight and standardization of outcomes of the Lifeline. With this award, Vibrant Emotional Health will directly support the much needed expansion of the behavioral health workforce for all designated national Lifeline backup centers, text/chat centers, and Spanish language crisis centers to ensure the Network can meet or exceed established metrics; provide direct support to increase the workforce at national Lifeline back-up centers, text/chat centers, and Spanish language crisis centers to expand the implementation of follow-up protocols; expand and enhance core Lifeline network functions; expand and facilitate timely and ongoing communication with the existing network of backup and text/chat centers to minimize wait time and maximize call connectivity; expand the ability of backup and text/chat centers to respond to sudden and large spikes in call volume immediately following a public service announcement, disaster, or other type of traumatic event; expand collaboration with backup and text/chat centers to ensure they have sufficient policies and procedures for the training and supervision of center staff in caller engagement, risk assessment, intervention, and linkage to appropriate services; develop and implement a quality improvement plan focusing on policies, first contact, assessment, referral, and access to local care to ensure there is a comprehensive and coordinated response to individuals at imminent risk for suicide; develop and implement a plan to support backup call centers, text/chat centers, and the Spanish language sub-network in accessing mobile crisis services and coordinating with 911 throughout the United States; provide technical assistance to states and crisis centers in communicating and aligning 988 implementation plans, including the ability to meet Key Performance Indicator expectations; establish interoperability with the VA infrastructure and operations to ensure veterans, service members, and families can access at the VA through authorized 988 phone and text services; and expand the Lifeline network by incorporating additional centers or developing formal agreements with service providers for populations at higher risk of suicide for the expansion of services, training, referrals, facilitated transfers and other approaches to link individuals in crisis with the most person centered and culturally appropriate responses. This is not a formal request for application. Assistance will be provided only to Vibrant Emotional Health based on the receipt of a satisfactory application that is approved by an independent review group. Funding Opportunity Title: Lifeline Expansion. Assistance Listing Number: 93.243. Authority: Section 520E-3 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended; and Section 9005 of the 21st Century Cures Act. Justification: Eligibility for this award is limited to the Mental Health Association of New York City, Inc. (DBA Vibrant Emotional Health). Vibrant Emotional Health is the current Lifeline system administrator and this award funds a rapid expansion of the ongoing Lifeline services to meet the anticipated demands of the FCC's 988 launch before July 2022. Since 2005, Vibrant Emotional Health has provided oversight and management of the Suicide Prevention Lifeline and its local call centers, backup centers, and chat/text functions with a network of over 180 centers in all fifty states. This longstanding history has positioned Vibrant Emotional Health as the best suited organization as the only identified organization with the required experience and national reach to work with the backup centers and chat/text organizations with expansion of their workforce and development of the infrastructure that is needed for the launch of 988 in July 2022. Vibrant Emotional Health's history, experience, and ongoing communications with these centers are critical given the time sensitivity of the need for sufficient capacity to be in place by July 2022. Several external evaluations have reinforced the evidence of effectiveness of Lifeline services through oversight of the Lifeline by Vibrant Emotional Health. The Federal Communication Commission has ordered that by July 16, 2022 every cell phone, land line and voice over internet provider in the United States must make 988 operational and this date of implementation is also a requirement in the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act. Given the anticipated significantly increased contact volumes with the universal availability of 988, a rapid upgrading of Lifeline capacity is required by July 2022. It would not be possible for any other organization to establish the relationships with crisis centers that Vibrant Emotional Health has built over the last 15 years by July 2022, running the risk of significant numbers of unanswered calls, chats, and texts. In addition, if these funds were awarded to another organization, oversight of the expanded backup and chat/text centers would be fragmented and the network would run the risk of inefficiencies and adverse outcomes to individuals in crisis during the period when the demand for Lifeline is expected to surge with the launch of 988. Coordination, quality monitoring, and rapid response would be compromised. Vibrant Emotional Health also has extensive engagement with the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) that helps ensure call connectivity between Vibrant Emotional Health and VCL, backup services, and engagement across the Lifeline local crisis centers on Veteran identification, care, and linkage to the VA. Vibrant Emotional Health has long been recognized throughout the nation for its state-of-art technology-enabled services, community wellness programs, and advocacy and education work and is uniquely qualified to carry-out the requirements of this funding opportunity.

NMFS is implementing a 2,000-lb (907.2-kg) possession limit for Atlantic herring for Management Area 1A. This is required because NMFS projects that herring catch from Area 1A will reach 92 percent of the Area's sub-annual catch limit before the end of the fishing year. This action is intended to prevent overharvest of herring in Area 1A, which would result in additional catch limit reductions in a subsequent year.

This document comprises three distinct groups of actions under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which are collectively intended to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other harmful air pollutants from the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category. First, the EPA proposes to revise the new source performance standards (NSPS) for GHGs and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category under the CAA to reflect the Agency's most recent review of the feasibility and cost of reducing emissions from these sources. Second, the EPA proposes emissions guidelines (EG) under the CAA, for states to follow in developing, submitting, and implementing state plans to establish performance standards to limit GHGs from existing sources (designated facilities) in the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category. Third, the EPA is taking several related actions stemming from the joint resolution of Congress, adopted on June 30, 2021 under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), disapproving the EPA's final rule titled, "Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources Review," Sept. 14, 2020 ("2020 Policy Rule"). This proposal responds to the President's January 20, 2021, Executive order (E.O.) titled "Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis," which directed the EPA to consider taking the actions proposed here.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain British Aerospace (Operations) Limited and British Aerospace Regional Aircraft Model Jetstream Series 200, Jetstream Model 3101, and Jetstream Model 3201 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) originated by an aviation authority of another country to identify and correct an unsafe condition on an aviation product. The MCAI identifies the unsafe condition as a bent control rod within the gust lock system, which may enable both power levers to be pushed into the flight range with the gust lock lever fully engaged. This proposed AD would require replacing the push rod assembly with a modified push rod assembly. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 12-month finding on a petition to list the bracted twistflower (Streptanthus bracteatus), a plant species from Texas, as a threatened species and designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list bracted twistflower as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act (a "4(d) rule"). We also propose to designate critical habitat for the bracted twistflower under the Act. In total, approximately 1,606 acres (650 hectares) in Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, and Travis Counties in Texas fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. In addition, we announce the availability of a draft economic analysis (DEA) of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the bracted twistflower. If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would extend the Act's protections to this species and its critical habitat.

In accordance with the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is initiating a process to consider designating a portion of waters along and offshore of the central coast of California as a national marine sanctuary. NOAA is initiating this process based on the area's qualities and boundaries as described in the community-based nomination \1\ submitted on July 17, 2015, excluding any geographical overlap of the boundaries proposed for the Morro Bay 399 Area as described in the July 29, 2021 Federal Register notice.\2\ The designation process will be conducted concurrently with a public process under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to prepare an environmental impact statement. NOAA is initiating this public scoping process to invite comments on the scope and significance of issues to be addressed in the environmental impact statement that are related to designating this area as a national marine sanctuary. The results of this scoping process will assist NOAA in moving forward with the designation process, including preparation and release of draft designation documents, and in formulating alternatives for the draft environmental impact statement, including developing national marine sanctuary boundaries, regulations, and a management plan. This scoping process will also inform the initiation of any consultations with federal, state, or local agencies, tribes, and other interested parties, as appropriate. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni), a terrestrial tortoise from Libya, Egypt, and Israel, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition requesting that the Egyptian tortoise be listed as an endangered or threatened species under the Act. After a review of the best scientific and commercial information available, we find that listing the species is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the Egyptian tortoise, as a threatened species with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add this species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the species.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) BR700-710A2-20 model turbofan engines. This AD was prompted by flight data obtained from airplanes equipped with certain Rockwell Collins avionics and auto- throttle systems that demonstrated significant oscillation of the engine rotor revolution speed during flight. This AD requires initial and repetitive recalculation of the consumed and remaining service life of certain life-limited parts (LLPs). This AD also requires removal of an LLP prior to its approved life limit or within 90 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a revision to the Washington State Implementation Plan (SIP) pertaining to adoption by reference of a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program by the State of Washington. The Clean Air Act (CAA) grants authority to the EPA to adopt Federal standards relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles, and generally preempts states from doing so. However, the CAA provides California the ability to adopt and enforce its own new motor vehicle emission standards, as long as the EPA approves California's standards via a preemption waiver. The CAA also allows other states to adopt California's new motor vehicle emission standards for which the EPA has granted such a waiver providing other relevant criteria are met. Washington adopted California's LEV emission standards in 2005, effective with new vehicles sold in model year 2009. Washington subsequently amended its new motor vehicle emissions program to incorporate California's LEV updates to its program. The purpose of this SIP revision is to implement programs to reduce vehicle emissions that contribute to formation of ground level ozone and fine particulate matter. Washington did not submit provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles or zero-emission vehicles requirements for inclusion in the SIP. The EPA is approving and incorporating by reference Washington's LEV SIP revision, as it relates to criteria pollutants, in accordance with the requirements of the CAA.

NMFS issues this temporary rule for a period of 30 days, to allow shrimp fishers to use limited tow times as an alternative to Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in specific Louisiana state waters (from 91[deg] 23' West longitude eastward to the Louisiana/Mississippi border, and seaward out 3 nautical miles (5.6 kilometers)). This action is necessary because environmental conditions resulting from Hurricane Ida are preventing fishers from using TEDs effectively.
