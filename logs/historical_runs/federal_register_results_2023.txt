The PAB also proposes to update the definition of prohibited discrimination to be consistent with changes in nondiscrimination laws. In addition, the PAB proposes to replace gendered pronouns with gender-neutral ones to reflect current usage practices. The General Accounting Office Personnel Act of 1980 provides authority to make these changes.

Recreation fee revenues collected at the new recreation fee site would be used for operation, maintenance, and improvement of the site. An analysis of nearby recreation fee sites with similar amenities shows the recreation fee that would be charged at the new recreation fee site is reasonable and typical of similar recreation fee sites in the area.

The U.S. Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is issuing a final rule that requires States to use State merit staff to provide Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service (ES) services. In the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), the Department proposed that this requirement would apply to all States. However, the Department recognizes three States that have been approved by the Department to administer ES services using alternative staffing models for decades and is allowing only these three States to continue using the alternative staffing models. The requirement to use State merit staff to provide all ES services applies to all other States, including those States that implemented staffing flexibility under the 2020 Final Rule. The Department additionally is revising the ES regulations to strengthen the provision of services to migrant or seasonal farmworkers (MSFWs) and to enhance the protections afforded by the Monitor Advocate System and the Employment Service and Employment-Related Law Complaint System (Complaint System). States have 24 months to comply with this final rule.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing revisions to the regulations for decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) and phenol, isopropylated phosphate (3:1) (PIP (3:1)), two of the five persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemicals addressed in final rules issued under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in January 2021. After receiving additional comments following the issuance of the 2021 PBT final rules, the Agency has determined that revisions to the decaBDE and PIP (3:1) regulations are necessary to address implementation issues and to reduce further exposures. As required under TSCA, these proposed requirements would, if finalized, reduce the potential for exposures to humans and the environment to decaBDE and PIP (3:1) to the extent practicable. The Agency is not proposing to revise the existing regulations for the other three PBT chemicals (2,4,6-TTBP, HCBD, and PCTP) at this time.

The Farm Credit Administration (FCA, we, our) is adopting a final rule that updates, restructures, and reorganizes our regulations that govern the appointment of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC) as the conservator or receiver of Farm Credit System (FCS or System) banks, associations, service corporations, and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation (Funding Corporation). The final rule also ensures FCA conservatorship and receivership regulations are consistent with the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill), which strengthens, updates, and clarifies FCSIC's powers as the conservator or receiver of these FCS institutions. Additionally, the final rule consolidates and reorganizes our conservatorship and receivership regulations, so they are easier to understand and use. We also made conforming amendments to definitional regulations to clarify that bridge System banks, while subject to FCA supervision and oversight, are not subject to FCA regulations that apply to other System institutions. We revised these definitions because several provisions of the Farm Credit Act expressly exempt bridge banks from certain legal requirements that apply to viable and solvent System banks.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2023-04- 15, which applied to certain Dassault Aviation Model FALCON 7X airplanes. AD 2023-04-15 required revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2023-04- 15 and requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

Since the beginning of 2021, 123 rail accidents/incidents have been reported to FRA as having been caused, in whole or in part, by severe weather conditions or weather-related events (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, flooding, mudslides, and summer heat). These extreme weather conditions and events not only present hazards to railroad workers, operations and infrastructure but can also severely impact the customers and communities relying on the railroads for travel and transportation of critical goods. To reduce weather-related accidents/incidents and improve the efficiency of the national rail network during severe weather events, FRA is issuing this Safety Advisory to recommend that railroads review existing policies, procedures, and operating rules related to predicting, monitoring, communicating, and operating during severe weather conditions or subsequent to extreme weather events. FRA also recommends that railroads collaborate to develop best practices for utilizing weather forecasting technologies, predictive weather models, and weather- related action plans throughout the industry.

NMFS issues this final rule to implement Amendment 123 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) Management Area (BSAI FMP). This final rule amends the regulations governing limits on Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) (halibut) prohibited species catch (PSC) to link the halibut PSC limit for the Amendment 80 commercial groundfish trawl fleet in the BSAI groundfish fisheries to halibut abundance. This final rule is necessary to comply with the obligation in the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) that FMPs minimize bycatch to the extent practicable. It is also consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Act's National Standards. This final rule is expected to minimize halibut mortality, and it may result in additional harvest opportunities in the commercial halibut fishery, as well as to the subsistence and recreational fisheries. This final rule is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson- Stevens Act, other applicable laws, and Amendment 123 to the BSAI FMP.

This final rule revises regulations governing the use of electronic monitoring (EM) in the Pacific Coast groundfish trawl fishery. This rulemaking modifies deadlines in Federal regulations for EM service providers to process EM data and submit vessel logbooks to NMFS. This action is intended to support the overarching goal of continually monitoring the Groundfish Trawl Rationalization Program for compliance with existing regulations in an economical and flexible manner while meeting the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act; MSA), the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and other applicable laws. This rulemaking also makes minor administrative changes to EM and other groundfish regulations to clarify the regulations, correct terminology, correct web addresses, and remove obsolete administrative requirements. Some aspects of this action remove duplicative requirements for mail notifications or mail-based record-keeping and reporting, which are also undertaken electronically. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many administrative notifications and reporting requirements were moved to electronic methods; this action revises the regulations to be consistent with current practice.

In this final rule, we are also establishing a payment for certain intensive outpatient services under Medicare, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, this final rule updates and refines requirements for hospitals to make public their standard charge information and enforcement of hospital price transparency. We are finalizing changes to the community mental health center (CMHC) Conditions of Participation (CoPs) to provide requirements for furnishing intensive outpatient (IOP) services, and we are finalizing the proposed personnel qualifications for mental health counselors (MHCs) and marriage and family therapists (MFTs). Additionally, we are finalizing the removal of discussion of the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) Medicare Code Editor (MCE) from the annual IPPS rulemakings, beginning with the fiscal year (FY) 2025 rulemaking.

In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, Treasury is issuing a final rule, exempting a new system of records, entitled "FinCEN .004--Beneficial Ownership Information System," from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) System is being established to implement the beneficial ownership information reporting and access requirements set out in the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which was enacted on January 1, 2021, as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020. The exemptions are intended to increase the value of the system for law enforcement purposes and to comply with the CTA's prohibitions against unauthorized disclosure of certain information.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/22/2023-25539/definition-of-energy-property-and-rules-applicable-to-the-energy-credit
This document contains proposed regulations that would amend the regulations relating to the energy credit for the taxable year in which eligible energy property is placed in service. This document also withdraws and reproposes, for additional clarity, portions of previously proposed regulations regarding the increased energy credit amount available if prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship requirements are met. In connection with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the proposed regulations would: update the types of energy property eligible for the energy credit, including additional types of energy property added by that law; clarify the application of new credit transfer rules to the energy credit recapture rules applicable to failures to satisfy the prevailing wage requirements, including notification requirements for eligible taxpayers; and include qualified interconnection costs in the basis of some lower-output energy properties. The proposed regulations would also provide additional requirements and rules generally applicable to energy property, such as rules regarding: functionally interdependent components; property that is an integral part of an energy property; application of an "80/20 Rule" to retrofitted energy property; dual use property; separate ownership of components of an energy property; property that could be eligible for multiple Federal income tax credits; and the election to treat qualified facilities eligible for the renewable electricity production credit instead as property eligible for the energy credit. The proposed regulations would impact taxpayers who invest in energy property eligible for the energy credit.

Each State then decides whether to participate in neither, one, or both relief options. This Notice provides the public each State's decision on whether to participate in marginal property relief.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 96-12-20, which applied to certain Lockheed Martin Corporation/Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G airplanes. AD 96-12-20 required visual inspections to detect loose, missing, or deformed fasteners in the upper truss mounts of certain engines, visual inspections to detect cracking in the associated lugs, repetitive ultrasonic inspections to detect cracking of the upper lugs, and replacement of damaged or cracked parts. AD 96-12-20 also provided for an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This AD was prompted by reports of fatigue cracking of the lugs of the upper truss mount, and by reports of cracks found prior to the initial inspection times required by AD 96-12-20 and the determination that the terminating action is no longer valid. This AD requires one-time inspections for cracked or severed engine truss mount upper lugs of the outboard engines, and replacement of the engine truss mount if necessary. This AD also revises the applicability to include all Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G airplanes, and all Model EC-130Q, C-130H, HP-C-130A, C-130A, and C-130B (including Model 282- 44A-05) airplanes. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

Lastly, the Commission is proposing to revise its regulations to eliminate the requirement that a depository holding customer funds must provide the Commission with read-only electronic access to such accounts for the FCM to treat the funds held in the accounts as customer segregated fund accounts.

Therefore, NMFS reduces both the commercial ACL and commercial annual catch target (ACT) for greater amberjack in the Gulf EEZ during the 2024 fishing year. This commercial ACL and ACT reduction is necessary to protect the Gulf greater amberjack resource.

This proposed rule would prohibit civil aircraft operations conducted with supplemental restraint systems (SRS) unless operators meet certain requirements for ensuring passenger safety during all phases of the operation. The FAA expects these proposed requirements would increase the safety of passengers during civil aircraft operations conducted with SRS. This proposal addresses recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General. Additionally, this proposed rule would codify, with updates, an Emergency Order currently in effect addressing safety concerns regarding the use of supplemental restraints. The proposed rule would apply to all civil aircraft operations conducted with use of SRS. The rule as proposed would not apply to parachute operations or rotorcraft external-load operations. Additionally, the proposed rule would not apply to operations conducted as public aircraft operations.

We propose to add new requirements to the Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS) to support and stabilize the Head Start workforce, including requirements for wages and benefits, breaks for staff, and enhanced supports for staff health and wellness. We also propose to enhance several existing requirements and add new requirements to promote consistent quality of services across Head Start programs. This includes proposed enhancements to requirements for mental health services to better integrate these services into every aspect of programs as well as elevate the role of mental health consultation to support the well-being of children, families, and staff. Enhancements are also proposed in the areas of family service, worker family assignments, identifying and meeting community needs, ensuring child safety, services for pregnant women and people, and alignment with State early childhood systems. Finally, we propose minor clarifications to existing standards to promote better transparency and clarity of understanding for grant recipients.

This document contains proposed regulations concerning the statutory disallowance rule enacted by the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 to disallow a Federal income tax deduction for a qualified conservation contribution made by a partnership or an S corporation after December 29, 2022, if the amount of the contribution exceeds 2.5 times the sum of each partner's or S corporation shareholder's relevant basis. The proposed regulations would provide guidance regarding this statutory disallowance rule, including definitions, appropriate methods to calculate the relevant basis of a partner or an S corporation shareholder, the three statutory exceptions to the statutory disallowance rule, and related reporting requirements. In addition, the proposed regulations would provide reporting requirements for partners and S corporation shareholders that receive a distributive share or pro rata share of any noncash charitable contribution made by a partnership or S corporation, regardless of whether the contribution is a qualified conservation contribution (and regardless of whether the contribution is of real property or other noncash property). These proposed regulations would affect partnerships and S corporations that claim qualified conservation contributions, and partners and S corporation shareholders that receive a distributive share or pro rata share, as applicable, of a noncash charitable contribution. This document also provides a notice of public hearing on these proposed regulations.

The item would also propose removal of the baud rate limitation in several additional bands. 6...................... WIRELINE............ TITLE: Reducing COMPETITION......... Regulatory Requirements for Rural Provider of Long-Distance Access Service (WC Docket No. 22-407). SUMMARY: The Commission will consider a Declaratory Ruling and Memorandum Opinion and Order that would grant the Minnesota Independent Equal Access Corporation (MIEAC) relief from dominant carrier regulation with respect to its provision of centralized equal access (CEA) service, and regulate MIEAC as a non-dominant competitive LEC for this service going forward. In light of declining demand, intervening exchange access service regulatory reforms, and technological changes in the voice services marketplace generally, dominant carrier regulation of MIEAC's CEA service is no longer necessary to serve the public interest. ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Embraer S.A. Model ERJ 190-100 STD, -100 LR, -100 IGW, -200 STD, -200 LR, and -200 IGW airplanes. This AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary and a determination by the design approval holder (DAH) that some structural elements are subject to widespread fatigue damage (WFD). This AD requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations, and for certain airplanes requires a structural modification of the wing lower skin panels, as specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-08-02 for all Safran Helicopter Engines, S.A. (Safran) (type certificate previously held by Turbomeca, S.A.) Model Arriel 2D and Arriel 2E engines. AD 2021-08-02 required replacing certain critical parts before reaching their published in-service life limits, performing scheduled maintenance tasks before reaching their published periodicity, and performing unscheduled maintenance tasks when the engine meets certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-08-02, Safran has revised the airworthiness limitation section (ALS) of the existing maintenance and overhaul manuals, introducing new and more restrictive instructions and maintenance tasks, which prompted this AD action. This AD requires updating the ALS of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, by incorporating the actions and associated thresholds and intervals, including life limits, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2020-15-07 for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) (type certificate previously held by Rolls-Royce plc) Model RB211-524G2-19, RB211-524G2- T-19, RB211-524G3-19, RB211-524G3-T-19, RB211-524H2-19, RB211-524H2-T- 19, RB211-524H-36, and RB211-524H-T-36 engines. AD 2020-15-07 required replacement of the low-pressure turbine (LPT) stage 1 disk with part number (P/N) UL37606, UL37607, UL37608, UL37722, or UL37790, installed. This AD was prompted by an updated analysis by the engine manufacturer, which indicates certain part-numbered and serial-numbered LPT stage 1 disks that have undergone rework could fail before the current published life limits. This AD retains the requirement to replace the LPT stage 1 disk and includes additional LPT stage 1 disks, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

AD 2018-02-10 required performing repetitive fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) to detect cracks in the outer diffuser case (ODC), removal of any ODC that fails inspection, and updating the mandatory inspections in the Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA). Since the FAA issued AD 2018-02-10, PW developed a modification to reduce the susceptibility of ODC cracking. This AD retains the ALS update requirement from AD 2018-02-10, requires replacing certain ODC part numbers with parts eligible for installation, expands the applicability to all ODC part numbers, and adjusts the compliance threshold of the FPIs of the ODC.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of the final guidance entitled "Notifying FDA of a Permanent Discontinuance or Interruption in Manufacturing of a Device Under Section 506J of the FD&C Act" and the draft guidance entitled "Select Updates for the 506J Guidance: 506J Device List and Additional Notifications." The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) requires manufacturers to notify FDA of a permanent discontinuance or an interruption in the manufacture of certain devices that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in supply of that device in the United States during or in advance of a public health emergency (PHE). This final guidance is intended to assist manufacturers in providing timely, informative notifications about changes in the production of certain medical device products that will help prevent or mitigate shortages of such devices. FDA is concurrently issuing a draft guidance to propose select updates to the final guidance "Notifying FDA of a Permanent Discontinuance or Interruption in Manufacturing of a Device Under Section 506J of the FD&C Act." This draft guidance proposes a list of device product codes for which a manufacturer of such devices is required to notify FDA in accordance with the FD&C Act (hereafter referred to as the "506J Device List") and clarifies that manufacturers may submit voluntary notifications regarding supply chain issues at any time, unrelated to the declaration or potential declaration of a PHE. This draft guidance is not final nor is it for implementation at this time.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing amendments to the regulations that govern the processes and timelines for state and Federal plans to implement emission guidelines under Clean Air Act (CAA) New Source Performance Standards for existing sources (the "implementing regulations"). The amendments include revisions to the timing requirements for state and the EPA actions related to plans; the addition of mechanisms to improve flexibility and efficiency in plan processes; and new requirements for demonstration of timely meaningful engagement with pertinent stakeholders--including, but not limited to, industry, small businesses, and communities most affected by and vulnerable to the impacts of the plan. This action additionally provides a process for states' consideration of `remaining useful life and other factors' (RULOF) in applying a standard of performance; amends the definition of standard of performance in the implementing regulations; and clarifies compliance flexibilities that states may choose to incorporate into state plans, including trading or averaging. Finally, this action adds requirements for the electronic submission of state plans and provides several other clarifications and minor revisions to the implementing regulations.

Requiring reporting of animal waste air emissions may advance the community right-to-know aspect of EPCRA by providing the public with information that may impact their health and the environment. This information may advance EPA's environmental justice goals of increasing the awareness of the potential impact these emissions have on communities with environmental justice concerns.

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for the re-entry of a space vehicle from the Starship Super Heavy launch by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (Space X). The temporary safety zone is located within the Coast Guard District Fourteen area of responsibility, approximately 129 nautical miles offshore of Oahu, Hawaii. The purpose of this rule is to ensure the safety of vessels, mariners, and the navigable waters in the safety zones before, during, and after the scheduled event. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of vessels and waterway users from the potential hazards created by reentry vehicle splashdowns and recovery operations in our exclusive economic zone. It is also necessary to provide for the safe recovery of reentry vehicles, and any personnel involved in reentry services, after the splashdown. This rule implements a special activities provision of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. Foreign-flagged vessels are encouraged to remain outside the safety zones. This rule prohibits U.S. flagged vessels from being in the safety zones unless authorized by the Commander of the Fourteenth Coast Guard District or a designated representative.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is amending the rules of practice in patent cases and the rules regarding the representation of others before the USPTO by creating a separate design patent practitioner bar whereby admitted design patent practitioners would practice in design patent proceedings only. Prior to this rulemaking, there was only one patent bar that applied to those who practice in patent matters before the Office, including in utility, plant, and design patents. The creation of a design patent practitioner bar does not impact the ability of those already registered to practice in any patent matters before the USPTO to continue to practice in any patent matters, including design patent matters, before the Office. Furthermore, it does not impact the ability of applicants for registration who meet the criteria to practice in all patent matters from qualifying for and upon passing the current registration exam, practicing in any patent matters before the Office, including design patent matters. Expanding the admission criteria of the patent bar encourages broader participation and keeps up with the ever-evolving technology and related teachings that qualify someone to practice before the USPTO. The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure will be updated in accordance with this final rule in due course.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the regional haze Staet implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by New Jersey on March 26, 2020, as satisfying applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA's Regional Haze Rule (RHR) for the program's second implementation period. New Jersey's SIP submission addresses the requirement that states must periodically revise their long-term strategies for making reasonable progress towards the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, anthropogenic impairment of visibility, including regional haze, in mandatory Class I Federal areas. The SIP submission also addresses other applicable requirements for the second implementation period of the regional haze program.

This action closes the White Hake Trimester Total Allowable Catch Area to Northeast multispecies common pool vessels fishing with trawl gear, sink gillnet gear, and longline/hook gear, except Handgear A and Handgear B vessels, through December 31, 2023. The closure is required because the common pool fishery is projected to have caught 90 percent of its Trimester 2 quota for white hake. This closure is intended to prevent an overage of the common pool's quota for this stock.

NMFS announces the approval of Amendment 31 to the Pacific Fishery Management Council's (Council) Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Amendment 31 defines stocks that are in need of conservation and management, consistent with the provisions and guidelines of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Amendment 31 defines stocks for 14 species within the fishery management unit. These species were prioritized because they had stock assessments in 2021 or 2023. Amendment 31 is necessary for NMFS to make stock status determinations, which in turn will help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, and achieve optimum yield. Amendment 31 is administrative in nature and does not change harvest levels or timing and location of fishing, nor does it revise the goals and objectives or the management frameworks of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is seeking public input from the science and engineering research and education community on implementing NSF Public Access Plan 2.0: Ensuring Open, Immediate, and Equitable Access to National Science Foundation Funded Research. This plan, described in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, represents an update to NSF current public access requirements in response to recent White House Office of Science and Technology Policy guidance. A primary consideration during the development of NSF's plan has been potential equity impacts of public access requirements. NSF's goal is to improve equity throughout the research life cycle, making data and opportunities available to all researchers, including those from marginalized communities and historically under-resourced institutions of higher education in the U.S. NSF is committed to considering the needs of the diverse US research community, including identifying possible unintended consequences that the plan and its implementation could produce.

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) withdraws the Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP) proposed rule, which was published in the Federal Register on December 28, 2022. The SIMP proposed rule intended to add species to SIMP pursuant to the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. In addition, the proposed rule would have amended SIMP regulations to clarify the responsibilities and definitions, and make other necessary administrative modernizations. In light of the extensive public comments received regarding the December 2022 proposed rule, NMFS has decided to conduct a comprehensive program review in order to strengthen the impact and effectiveness of SIMP. Critical aspects of that review will include better defining the problem that we are working to address and establishing clear, achievable goals through constructive engagement with our stakeholders. Comments received on the December 2022 proposed rule will also be taken into consideration as part of the review. While NMFS conducts this comprehensive review, SIMP will continue to operate in its current form, all existing requirements remain in force, and the list of priority species currently subject to SIMP requirements remains unchanged. In addition, NMFS will continue to support industry and other stakeholders in SIMP compliance during the review.

This notice announces the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) creation and implementation of a family reunification parole (FRP) process for Ecuadorians. Under this process, certain Ecuadorian principal beneficiaries of an approved Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, and their immediate family members, will be issued advance authorization to travel to the United States to seek a discretionary grant of parole into the United States for a period of up to three years, rather than remain outside the United States while awaiting availability of their immigrant visas. This process will allow family members to reunite in the United States while they wait for their immigrant visas to become available. This process is voluntary and intended to provide an additional lawful, safe, and orderly avenue for migration from Ecuador to the United States as an alternative to irregular migration to help relieve pressure at the Southwest Border (SWB) and to reunite families, consistent with U.S. national security interests and foreign policy priorities. The process complements other efforts to collaboratively manage migration in the Western Hemisphere and at the SWB as the U.S. Government (USG) continues to implement its broader, multi-pronged, regional strategy to address the challenges posed by irregular migration.

The Regional Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS, announces receipt of an exempted fishing permit (EFP) application, and is considering issuance of an EFP that seeks exemption from the requirements at requiring vessel owners and operators to retain sablefish, rex sole, Pacific sanddab and California halibut when on a declared optimized retention bottom trawl or non-whiting midwater trawl trip. At this time, NMFS is considering allowing participants in the EFP to add sablefish and rex sole to their Vessel Monitoring Plans' (VMP) allowable discard list. NMFS does not expect to add the other two species to this EFP because Pacific sanddab is already listed as an allowable discard, thus no exemption is needed, and NMFS intends to address California halibut discard rules through a future regulatory change rather than an EFP. NMFS requests public comment on the application.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/15/2023-25122/movement-of-organisms-modified-or-produced-through-genetic-engineering-notice-of-proposed-exemptions
We are advising the public that we are proposing to add five new types of genetic modifications a plant can contain and be exempt from the regulations for the movement of organisms modified or produced through genetic engineering because such modifications could otherwise be achieved through conventional breeding methods. First, we propose any diploid or autopolyploid plant with any combination of loss of function modifications (i.e., a modification that eliminates a gene's function) in one to all alleles of a single genetic locus, or any allopolyploid plant with any combination of loss of function modifications in one or both alleles of a single genetic locus on up to four pairs of homoeologous chromosomes, without the insertion of exogenous DNA, would qualify for exemption. Second, we propose that any diploid or autopolyploid plant in which the genetic modification is a single contiguous deletion of any size, resulting from cellular repair of one or two targeted DNA breaks on a single chromosome or at the same location(s) on two or more homologous chromosomes, without insertion of DNA, or with insertion of DNA in the absence of a repair template, would qualify for exemption. Third, we propose to extend the modifications described in certain existing exemptions in the regulations to all alleles of a genetic locus on the homologous chromosomes of an autopolyploid plant. Fourth, we propose that plants with up to four modifications that individually qualify for exemption and are made simultaneously or sequentially would be exempt from regulation, provided that each modification is at a different genetic locus. Fifth, we propose that plants that have previously completed a voluntary review confirming exempt status and that have subsequently been produced, grown, and observed consistent with conventional breeding methods appropriate for the plant species, could be successively modified in accordance with the exemptions. This action would reduce the regulatory burden for developers of certain plants modified using genetic engineering that are not expected to pose plant pest risks greater than the plant pest risks posed by plants modified by conventional breeding methods.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting public comment on a white paper describing the benefits of the creation, submission, review, approval, and distribution of structured content and digital pesticide labels. Structured labels are information or content that is organized in a predictable way, and digital content is those categorized fields with metadata. The current process for submitting, reviewing, and approving labels is time-consuming for both registrants and regulators. The increasing complexity of pesticide labels, inconsistent label language across products, and inconsistent placement of information on the labels often creates significant challenges for pesticide users and the public seeking information about how to use the products. Structured content and digital labels could streamline and standardize the submission, review, and access to label content, providing benefits across the spectrum of stakeholders. In addition to developing a framework for structured content and digital labels, EPA intends to identify the key information needed for the structured digital label.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/15/2023-25199/recruitment-and-relocation-incentive-waivers
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a proposed rule to expand the authority to approve waivers of the normal payment limitations on recruitment and relocation incentives. An expansion of the waiver approval authority would provide agencies with access to higher payment limitations for these flexibilities without requesting approval from OPM. Under this proposed rule, agencies would have the authority to approve a recruitment or relocation incentive of up to 50 percent of an employee's annual rate of basic pay multiplied by the number of years in a service agreement (not to exceed 100 percent of annual basic pay) based on a critical agency need. In addition, this proposed rule would give agencies flexibility to set the length of the required service period for recruitment incentives to a period less than 6 months but not more than 4 years, which would align the service requirements for recruitment incentives with those for relocation incentives and provide agencies with additional flexibility in taking advantage of this incentive as a recruitment tool.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a 60- day public comment period on the draft revision of the Technical Guidance for Assessing Environmental Justice in Regulatory Analysis (EJ Technical Guidance). The EJ Technical Guidance was first published in 2016. The EPA is updating it to reflect the state of the science; new peer-reviewed agency guidance; and new terminology, priorities, and direction, including Executive Order 14096. The purpose of this guidance is to outline analytic expectations and discuss technical approaches and methods that can be used by agency analysts to evaluate EJ concerns for regulatory actions. This technical guidance builds on the EPA's experience in evaluating environmental justice concerns within the rulemaking analytic process and underscores the EPA's ongoing commitment to ensuring the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) proposes to revise its regulations to conform with the Fair Hiring in Banking Act (FHBA)--which was enacted on and immediately effective as of December 23, 2022. Among other provisions, the FHBA excluded or exempted categories of otherwise-covered offenses from the scope of statutory prohibitions on participation in banking. These categories pertain to certain older offenses, offenses committed by individuals 21 or younger, and "certain lesser offenses." The FHBA also clarified several definitions in section 19 and provided application-processing procedures. The FDIC considers most of the proposed revisions to its regulations to be required by the FHBA. Other proposed revisions reflect the FDIC's interpretation of statutory prohibitions in light of the FHBA.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-13-16, which applies to all GE Aviation Czech s.r.o. (GEAC) (type certificate previously held by WALTER Engines a.s., Walter a.s., and MOTORLET a.s.) Model M601D-11 engines; and AD 2022-14-12, which applies to certain GEAC Model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, M601E- 11S, and M601F engines. AD 2022-13-16 requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing engine maintenance manual (EMM) to incorporate a visual inspection of the centrifugal compressor case for cracks. AD 2022-14-12 requires replacing the propeller shaft for Model M601F engines. AD 2022-14-12 also requires calculating the accumulated life of the propeller shaft and replacing the propeller shaft, if necessary, for model M601D-11, M601E-11, M601E-11A, M601E-11AS, and M601E-11S engines. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-13-16 and AD 2022-14-12, the manufacturer revised the ALS of the existing EMM to introduce new and more restrictive tasks and limitations, expand the applicability to all Model M601 engines, and incorporate certain requirements addressed by AD 2021-13-07 and AD 2023-01-10, which prompted this proposed AD. This proposed AD would require revising the ALS of the existing EMM and the operator's existing approved engine maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new and more restrictive tasks and limitations, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Coast Guard is issuing a final rule for recreational vessel owners to select a recreational vessel endorsement on a Certificate of Documentation (COD) with a validity of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 years. Currently, our regulations require that a COD will be effective for a 5-year period. Congress passed, and the President signed, the self-executing National Defense Authorization Act of 2022 (2022 Act), which directs the Coast Guard to issue recreational vessel CODs for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 years. By updating the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to reflect this change, this final rule harmonizes the requirements of the 2022 Act, aligns CFR text with current Coast Guard policy, and provides vessel owners' statutorily directed option to select the validity period of their COD that best suits their individual needs.

Safer Choice helps consumers, businesses, and purchasers find products that perform and contain ingredients that are safer for human health and the environment. DfE is a similar program currently used by EPA for the purpose of helping consumers and commercial buyers identify antimicrobial products that meet the health and safety standards of the normal pesticide registration process required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as well as other EPA DfE criteria. The Agency will hold a webinar and is requesting written stakeholder comment on the proposed changes to the Standard.

[FEDERAL REGISTER PAGE 35-50] 2023-11-14 00:00:00Z | Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing
Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/14/2023-24034/debit-card-interchange-fees-and-routing
Regulation II implements a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires the Board to establish standards for assessing whether the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. Under the current rule, for a debit card transaction that does not qualify for a statutory exemption, the interchange fee can be no more than the sum of a base component of 21 cents, an ad valorem component of 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, and a fraud-prevention adjustment of 1 cent if the issuer meets certain fraud-prevention-standards. The Board developed the current interchange fee cap in 2011 using data voluntarily reported to the Board by large debit card issuers concerning transactions performed in 2009. Since that time, data collected by the Board every other year on a mandatory basis from large debit card issuers show that certain costs incurred by these issuers have declined significantly; however, the interchange fee cap has remained the same. For this reason, the Board proposes to update all three components of the interchange fee cap based on the latest data reported to the Board by large debit card issuers. Further, the Board proposes to update the interchange fee cap every other year going forward by directly linking the interchange fee cap to data from the Board's biennial survey of large debit card issuers. Initially, under the proposal, the base component would be 14.4 cents, the ad valorem component would be 4.0 basis points (multiplied by the value of the transaction), and the fraud-prevention adjustment would be 1.3 cents for debit card transactions performed from the effective date of the final rule to June 30, 2025. The Board also proposes a set of technical revisions to Regulation II.

NMFS is implementing a 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) possession limit for Atlantic herring for Management Area 1A. This is required because NMFS projects that herring catch from Area 1A will reach 92 percent of the Area's sub-annual catch limit before the end of the fishing year. This action is intended to prevent overharvest of herring in Area 1A, which would result in additional catch limit reductions in a subsequent year.

EPA is proposing to remove a duplicative exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of L-lactic acid, herein referred to as lactic acid, when applied to dairy-processing equipment and food-processing equipment and utensils. In addition, the Agency is proposing to establish exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of lactic acid when used as a fruit and vegetable wash in or on all raw agricultural commodities, and for indirect or inadvertent residues of lactic acid in or on all livestock commodities, when residues are present therein as a result of animal drinking water coming into contact with hard non-porous surfaces treated with lactic acid (i.e., troughs). This rulemaking is proposed on the Agency's own initiative under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), in order to implement the tolerance actions EPA identified during its review of this chemical as part of the Agency's registration review program under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on December 16, 2021. The collection involves in-person sessions between researchers and certified pilots. Computerized neurocognitive tests are a non-invasive way to measure cognitive function (e.g., attention, working memory, information processing speed, reaction time) and are used as part of the FAA's overall aeromedical physical exam process to determine if a pilot is safe to operate an aircraft within the National Airspace System (NAS). Neurocognitive tests are required only for pilots with certain medical conditions associated with aeromedically significant cognitive impairments (i.e., not all pilots are tested). The FAA needs to ensure that the tests and data used to maintain the safety of the NAS are based on the most current scientific knowledge. The purpose of this IC effort is to obtain updated pilot normative data for the neurocognitive tests under consideration. The information collection (IC) effort will be used to potentially revise the FAA's Aviation Medical Examiners (AME) Guide, update clinical practices, and assure aeromedical safety. Information will be collected from representative pilots across the United States, who will complete two different 1-hour neurocognitive tests. Total IC effort/time per person will be approximately four hours (i.e., to include check-in processing, informed consent, neurocognitive test-taking, rest breaks, and participant debrief).

On January 23, 2017, APHIS withdrew the 2017 HPA final rule from publication without undertaking notice and comment procedures, in accordance with a memorandum that was issued by the Executive Office of the President on January 20, 2017. However, following a lawsuit, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found this withdrawal to be deficient. The District Court subsequently ordered that USDA could remedy this deficiency by undertaking notice and comment procedures on the proposed withdrawal. APHIS therefore issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to withdraw the 2017 HPA final rule, and we are finalizing that withdrawal based on the comments received.

Through this proposed rule, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) seeks to eliminate the tester restrictions for Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) grantees and for Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) agencies that forbid FHIP and FHAP recipients from using fair housing testers with prior felony convictions or convictions of crimes involving fraud or perjury. This proposed rule would make HUD's programs as inclusive as possible for people with criminal records, consistent with Secretary Marcia Fudge's April 12, 2022 Memorandum, "Eliminating Barriers That May Unnecessarily Prevent Individuals with Criminal Histories from Participating in HUD Program," and ensure that FHIP and FHAP funded entities are able to fully investigate criminal background screening policies that are potentially discriminatory under federal civil rights laws by using testers with actual criminal backgrounds.

The Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2020 (PFCSA) provides that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission) must promulgate a rule to require flame mitigation devices in portable fuel containers that impede the propagation of flame into the container, unless the Commission determines that there is a voluntary standard for flame mitigation devices that achieves the same result. In January 2023, the Commission published in the Federal Register a notice of its determinations under the PFCSA that three such voluntary standards collectively apply to all known classes of portable fuel containers. Pursuant to the PFCSA, therefore, the requirements of the three voluntary standards are treated as a consumer product safety rule under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA). ASTM then notified the Commission that one standard had been revised. The Commission evaluated the revised standard and found that the revisions carry out the purposes of the PFCSA. Accordingly the revisions will be incorporated into the mandatory standard for portable fuel containers. This direct final rule creates a new part codifying the incorporation by reference of this revised standard and the other two voluntary standards that are mandatory under the PFCSA.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/31/2023-23413/changes-to-reporting-requirements-for-per--and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-and-to-supplier
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is adding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) subject to reporting under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA) pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (NDAA) to the list of Lower Thresholds for Chemicals of Special Concern (chemicals of special concern). These PFAS already have a lower reporting activity threshold of 100 pounds. The addition of these PFAS to the list of chemicals of special concern means such PFAS are subject to the same reporting requirements as other chemicals of special concern (i.e., it eliminates the use of the de minimis exemption and the option to use Form A and would limit the use of range reporting for PFAS). Removing the availability of these burden-reduction reporting options will result in a more complete picture of the releases and waste management quantities for these PFAS. EPA is removing the availability of the de minimis exemption for purposes of the Supplier Notification Requirements for all chemicals on the list of chemicals of special concern. This will help ensure that purchasers of mixtures and trade name products containing such chemicals are informed of their presence in mixtures and products they purchase to better inform any TRI reporting obligations.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of exemptions that would permit the licensee to reduce its emergency planning (EP) activities at the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, collectively referred to as the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC). Specifically, Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holtec International (Holtec) is seeking exemptions on behalf of Holtec Indian Point 2, LLC ("Holtec IP2") and Holtec Indian Point 3, LLC ("Holtec IP3"), the licensees, that would eliminate the requirements to maintain formal offsite radiological emergency plans, as well as reduce the scope of some of the onsite EP activities based on the reduced risks at IPEC, which is permanently shut down and defueled. However, requirements for an onsite radiological emergency plan and for certain onsite capabilities to communicate and coordinate with offsite response authorities would be retained. In addition, offsite EP provisions would still exist through State and local government use of a comprehensive emergency management plan process, in accordance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101, "Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans." The NRC staff is issuing an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) associated with the proposed exemptions.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to address the unreasonable risk of injury to human health presented by trichloroethylene (TCE) under its conditions of use as documented in EPA's November 2020 Risk Evaluation for TCE and January 2023 revised risk determination for TCE pursuant to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). TCE is widely used as a solvent in a variety of industrial, commercial and consumer applications including for hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) production, vapor and aerosol degreasing, and in lubricants, greases, adhesives, and sealants. TSCA requires that when EPA determines a chemical substance presents unreasonable risk that EPA address by rule the unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment and apply requirements to the extent necessary so the chemical no longer presents unreasonable risk. EPA determined that TCE presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health due to the significant adverse health effects associated with exposure to TCE, including non-cancer effects (liver toxicity, kidney toxicity, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and developmental toxicity) as well as cancer (liver, kidney, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) from chronic inhalation and dermal exposures to TCE. TCE is a neurotoxicant and is carcinogenic to humans by all routes of exposure. The most sensitive adverse effects of TCE exposure are non-cancer effects (developmental toxicity and immunosuppression) for acute exposures and developmental toxicity and autoimmunity for chronic exposures. To address the identified unreasonable risk, EPA is proposing to: prohibit all manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of TCE and industrial and commercial use of TCE for all uses, with longer compliance timeframes and workplace controls for certain processing and industrial and commercial uses (including proposed phaseouts and time-limited exemptions); prohibit the disposal of TCE to industrial pre-treatment, industrial treatment, or publicly owned treatment works, with a time-limited exemption for cleanup projects; and establish recordkeeping and downstream notification requirements.

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) seeks comment to refresh the record in the rulemaking on Modernizing and Expanding Access to the 70/80/90 GHz Bands (85 FR 40168, July 6, 2020; 86 FR 60436, Nov. 2, 2021) to address the potential for use of the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, 92-94 GHz, and the 94.1- 95 GHz (70/80/90 GHz) bands to provide broadband internet access to consumers and communities that may otherwise lack robust, consistent connectivity. Specifically, the Commission previously proposed new and updated rules to further enable non-Federal uses of the 70/80/90 GHz bands, which are currently allocated on a co-primary basis for Federal and non-Federal use. This document seeks to refresh the overall record in the docket and seeks comment, in particular, on the proposals made in a filing by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) on October 17, 2023 (NTIA October 17 Filing). In that filing, NTIA proposed technical rules and interference mitigation measures, including operating parameters for links to endpoints in motion in 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz, to protect current or planned Federal operations in these frequencies and in adjacent bands.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its spent fuel storage regulations by revising the Holtec International HI- STORM 100 Cask System listing within the "List of approved spent fuel storage casks" to include Renewed Amendment No. 17 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1014. Because this amendment is subsequent to the renewal of the HI-STORM 100 Cask System Certificate of Compliance No. 1014 and, therefore, subject to the Aging Management Program requirements of the renewed certificate, NRC is referring to it as "Renewed Amendment No. 17." Renewed Amendment No. 17 updates the HI- STORM 100 Cask System description in the certificate of compliance to indicate that only the portions of the components that contact the pool water need to be made of stainless steel or aluminum. This amendment also includes minor editorial and formatting changes to the technical specifications that do not change the substantive technical information of the certificate of compliance.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) amends its regulations concerning requests for Commission records available in the Public Reference Room and from the Commission's website. Specifically, the Commission's regulations are revised to remove references to the physical Public Reference Room at the Commission's headquarters, as the Commission no longer has a physical Public Reference Room. The revised regulations will direct the public to access the records that were formerly available in the Commission's physical Public Reference Room, which was located at the Commission's headquarters, 888 First Street NE, Washington, DC 20426, through the Commission's website. Other Commission regulations are being amended to reflect this change to provide consistency by directing the public to the Commission's website for records and/or assistance in obtaining Commission records.

URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/30/2023-23428/procedures-for-chemical-risk-evaluation-under-the-toxic-substances-control-act-tsca
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, "the Agency") is proposing to amend the procedural framework rule for conducting risk evaluations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The purpose of risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or non-risk factors, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, under the conditions of use. EPA has reconsidered the procedural framework rule for conducting such risk evaluations and determined that certain aspects of that framework should be revised to better align with applicable court decisions and the statutory text, to reflect the Agency's experience implementing the risk evaluation program following enactment of the 2016 TSCA amendments, and to allow for consideration of future scientific advances in the risk evaluation process without need to further amend the Agency's procedural rule.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), expand hunting opportunities on three National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs). We also make changes to existing station-specific regulations in order to reduce the regulatory burden on the public, increase access for hunters and anglers on Service lands and waters, and comply with a Presidential mandate for plain language standards. Finally, the best available science, analyzed as part of this rulemaking, indicates that lead ammunition and tackle have negative impacts on both wildlife and human health. In this rule, Blackwater, Chincoteague, Eastern Neck, Erie, Great Thicket, Patuxent Research Refuge, Rachel Carson, and Wallops Island NWRs each adopt a non-lead requirement, which will take effect on September 1, 2026. While the Service continues to evaluate the future of lead use in hunting and fishing on Service lands and waters, this rulemaking does not include any opportunities increasing or authorizing the new use of lead beyond fall 2026.

The Forest Service is amending its locatable minerals rules to provide mine operators with a broader array of options for securing financial assurance for funding reclamation work. Locatable mineral operations on National Forest System lands must be conducted to minimize adverse environmental impacts on National Forest surface resources, which often includes reclamation at the conclusion of operations. Current regulations provide that the Forest Service may require the operator to furnish a "bond" to fund reclamation work. However, the financial assurance mechanisms are limited to surety bonds, cash, and negotiable securities. This rule will expand those options. It does not change requirements for surface resource and environmental protection. Rather, it provides additional options for obtaining the financial assurance necessary to be sure that those requirements will be met.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of the Draft Basis for Section 3116 Determination for Closure of the Calcined Solids Storage Facility at the Idaho National Laboratory Site (Draft CSSF 3116 Basis Document). The Draft CSSF 3116 Basis Document demonstrates that the Calcined Solids Storage Facility (CSSF) at closure after waste retrieval is not high-level radioactive waste (HLW) and may be disposed of in place as low-level radioactive waste (LLW). DOE prepared the Draft CSSF 3116 Basis Document pursuant to Section 3116 of the "Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005" (hereafter NDAA Section 3116). DOE is consulting with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and is also making the Draft CSSF 3116 Basis Document available for comments from states, Tribal Nations, stakeholders, and the public. After consultation with the NRC, carefully considering comments received, and performing any necessary revisions of analyses and technical documents, DOE will prepare a final CSSF 3116 Basis Document. Based on the final document, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the NRC, may determine in the future whether the stabilized CSSF bins (including integral equipment), transport lines, and any residual waste remaining therein at closure are non-HLW and may be disposed of in place as LLW.

This rule proposes to correct 2024 harvest specifications for several species of groundfish where the numerical values were mathematically calculated incorrectly and do not accurately reflect the harvest policy recommendations of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). These harvest specifications are for groundfish caught in the U.S. exclusive economic zone seaward of Washington, Oregon, and California, consistent with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) and the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (PCGFMP). This proposed rule would revise harvest limits or allocations that were calculated based on incorrect annual catch limits. This action would implement corrected numerical values that align with the Council's intended harvest policy decisions and considers the most recent fishery information available at the time those policies were recommended.

NMFS announces its request for applications for the 2024 shark research fishery from commercial shark fishermen with directed or incidental shark limited access permits. The shark research fishery allows for the collection of fishery-dependent and biological data for future stock assessments and to meet the research objectives of the Agency. The only commercial vessels authorized to land sandbar sharks are those participating in the shark research fishery. Shark research fishery permittees may also land other large coastal sharks (LCS), small coastal sharks (SCS), smoothhound, and pelagic sharks. Commercial shark fishermen who are interested in participating in the shark research fishery need to submit a completed Shark Research Fishery Permit Application to be considered.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD-500-1A10 and BD-500-1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of multiple occurrences of low clearance or fouling between certain wiring harnesses and a hydraulic bracket and structure in the wing trailing edge area that were detected on the production line. This proposed AD would require inspecting certain wiring harnesses for any damage and clearance to adjacent structure and corrective actions, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also require an inspection report. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing the availability of and soliciting comment on the near-term strategies described in this document to help the Agency meet its obligations and commitments under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), which requires, among other things, that EPA screen for and protect against endocrine disrupting effects in humans. An important part of these obligations and commitments is the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP), which EPA established in 1998 as a two-tier endocrine screening and testing process for pesticides and other chemicals. After over two decades of implementing the EDSP and other aspects of the mandate in FFDCA, EPA has developed near-term strategies to begin addressing the challenges it has encountered and to rebuild the EDSP. This document covers only the initial strategies that EPA is taking over the next several years to generate momentum toward its longer-term goal of timely addressing all its endocrine screening data needs and decisions. Through this notice and to help implement its strategies, EPA is also seeking additional endocrine data on two groups of active ingredients currently undergoing registration review, or explanations of why the additional data are unnecessary for EPA to make its FIFRA and FFDCA decisions.

NEH intends to award $491,049 to the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition (NABS) for continued survey work and prioritization of primary sources documenting the history of Indian boarding schools in the U.S.; digitization and description of 120,000 pages of federal boarding school records held by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); and collaboration among source communities, the National Indian Boarding School Digital Archive Data Aggregation Working Group, the Social Networks and Archival Context cooperative, and federal partners. This action is necessary to further the development of digital access to records significant to public understanding of the history and impacts of Indian boarding schools in the U.S. Because NABS has invested four years into developing a unique platform with the technical considerations to aggregate boarding school records of various sizes and formats and leads an established community of practice creating standards and best practices in boarding school record curation, NEH determined that a competition to fund the construction of a similar platform and capacities would be uneconomical and impractical.

The Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act, section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA), requires the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) to promulgate consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler products. These standards are to be substantially the same as applicable voluntary standards, or more stringent than the voluntary standards if the Commission concludes that more stringent requirements would further reduce the risk of injury associated with the product. The Commission is proposing a safety standard for Infant and Infant/Toddler Rockers (rockers). The Commission is also proposing to amend CPSC's consumer registration requirements to add rockers as identified durable infant or toddler products and to amend CPSC's list of notice of requirements (NORs) to include rockers.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109E, A109S, AW109SP, A119, and AW119 MKII helicopters. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of excessive axial play on the ball bearing of the lower half of the main rotor (MR) rotating scissor assembly. This AD requires one-time scissor coupling and axial play inspections and repetitive quantitative axial play inspections and, depending on the results, additional inspections and replacing certain parts. This AD also requires reporting information and prohibits installing certain parts unless certain inspections have been accomplished. These requirements are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Piaggio Aviation S.p.A. (Piaggio) Model P-180 airplanes. This AD is prompted by a report of corrosion on the various aluminum alloy reinforcements in the horizontal stabilizer (HS) central box caused by a humid environment inside the box from water ingress and/or condensation. This AD requires a one-time detailed inspection of the HS central box for corrosion; an assessment of the corrosion level; and depending on the determination, repetitive detailed inspections of the HS central box for corrosion and the internal composite structure for surface cracks, distortion, and damage; and repair or replacement of the HS assembly. Repair or replacement of the HS assembly is terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine endangered species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the black-capped petrel (Pterodroma hasitata), a pelagic seabird species that nests on the island of Hispaniola and spends the rest of its life at sea. The species forages in high concentration off the coast of North Carolina; however, the marine range extends across much of the western Atlantic (Nova Scotia to Venezuela) and into the Caribbean Sea and northern Gulf of Mexico. This rule extends the protections of the Act to the black-capped petrel.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-15, which applies to certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1100G series engines; and AD 2023-16-07, which applies to certain IAE LLC Model PW1100G series engines and PW1400G series engines. AD 2022-19-15 requires an angled ultrasonic inspection (AUSI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd- stage disk, and replacement if necessary. AD 2023-16-07 requires an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub (also known as the HPT 1st-stage disk) and HPT 2nd-stage hub (also known as the HPT 2nd-stage disk) for cracks, and replacement if necessary, which is terminating action for AD 2022-19-15. Since the FAA issued those two ADs, an investigation determined an increased risk of powder metal anomalies for all powder metal parts in certain powder metal production campaigns, which are susceptible to failure significantly earlier than previously determined. This proposed AD would retain the AUSI requirement for certain HPT 1st-stage and HPT 2nd-stage hubs from AD 2023-16-07. This proposed AD would also require performing an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage hub, high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7), and HPC 8th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-8) for cracks and replacement if necessary. This proposed AD would also require accelerated replacement of the HPC IBR-7, HPC IBR-8, HPC rear hub, HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 1st-stage air seal, HPT 1st-stage blade retaining plate, HPT 2nd-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage blade retaining plate, and HPT 2nd-stage rear seal. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-27- 09, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2022-27-09 required repetitively inspecting the vibration level on the tail rotor drive shaft and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. AD 2022-27-09 also required reporting information and prohibited installing certain rotor drive shafts unless the inspection was done. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-27- 09, Airbus Helicopters revised its service information to update the procedures for inspecting that vibration level, reduce an allowable vibration level, and clarify when a balance correction may be accomplished. This AD was prompted by the determination that a certain vibration measurement tool was providing unexpected results and therefore the threshold must be revised. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2022-27-09 and also revises the procedures for inspecting the vibration level on the tail rotor drive shaft and depending on these results, requires replacing certain parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Washington, through the Department of Ecology on November 12, 2019. The revisions were submitted by Washington in response to EPA's June 12, 2015 "SIP call" in which EPA found a substantially inadequate Washington SIP provision providing affirmative defenses that operate to limit the jurisdiction of the Federal court in an enforcement action related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA's approval of the SIP revisions removes the substantially inadequate provision which corrects the deficiency identified in the 2015 SSM SIP call. Washington withdrew some portions of the revisions submitted that were not identified in the 2015 SSM SIP call and therefore EPA is not taking final action on those withdrawn portions.

The Coast Guard is updating its user fees for seagoing towing vessels that are 300 gross tons or more and revising user fees for other inspected towing vessels. The Coast Guard is issuing these updates because it is required to establish and maintain a fair fee for its vessel inspection services and to separate the fees for inspection options that involve third-party auditors and surveyors from inspection options that do not involve third parties. Under this final rule, owners and operators of vessels using the Alternate Compliance Program, Streamlined Inspection Program, or the Towing Safety Management System options will pay a lower fee than vessels that use the traditional Coast Guard inspection option.

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) amends its amateur radio rules to eliminate the limitations on the symbol rate (also known as baud rate)--the rate at which the carrier waveform amplitude, frequency, and/or phase is varied to transmit information--applicable to data emissions in certain amateur bands. In place of the baud rate, the Commission sets a bandwidth limitation of 2.8 kilohertz in the respective amateur bands, consistent with the Commission's treatment of other wireless radio services, which also have service-specific bandwidth limitations. This bandwidth limitation will promote continued sharing in these amateur bands.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled "Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs." The guidance addresses the verification systems that manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers must have in place to comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as amended by the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Specifically, the guidance covers the statutory verification systems requirements that include the quarantine and investigation of a product determined to be suspect and the quarantine and disposition of a product determined to be illegitimate. The guidance also addresses the statutory requirement for notification to the Agency of a product that has been cleared by a manufacturer, repackager, wholesale distributor, or dispenser (also referred to as "trading partners") after a suspect product investigation because it is determined that the product is not an illegitimate product. Finally, the guidance addresses the statutory requirement for responding to requests for verification and processing saleable returns. The guidance finalizes the revised draft guidance "Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs," issued on March 10, 2022.

This final rule amends FHWA's regulations governing national performance management measures and establishes a method for the measurement and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with transportation (GHG measure). It requires State departments of transportation (State DOT) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) to establish declining carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) targets for the GHG measure and report on progress toward the achievement of those targets. The rule does not mandate how low targets must be. Rather, State DOTs and MPOs have flexibility to set targets that are appropriate for their communities and that work for their respective climate change and other policy priorities, as long as the targets aim to reduce emissions over time. The FHWA will assess whether State DOTs have made significant progress toward achieving their targets.

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts changes to its rules aimed at expediting the initial license application processing for satellite operators. The Commission establishes timeframes for placing satellite and earth station applications on public notice, eliminates a procedural rule that prevents consideration of requests for waiver of the International Table of Frequency Allocations, and removes the prohibition on licensed-but-unbuilt systems for non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) operators. Additionally, the Commission creates a new, streamlined processing framework for earth station operators to add satellite points of communication under certain circumstances. Finally, the Commission lays the groundwork for a broader Transparency Initiative led by the Space Bureau to provide clarity and access to applicants when interfacing with the Commission's license application processes and filing system.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000-AE3, Trent 1000-CE3, Trent 1000-D3, Trent 1000-G3, Trent 1000-H3, Trent 1000-J3, Trent 1000-K3, Trent 1000-L3, Trent 1000-M3, Trent 1000-N3, Trent 1000-P3, Trent 1000-Q3, and Trent 1000-R3 engines. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of wear in the combining spill-valve (CSV) assembly of certain hydro-mechanical units (HMUs). This proposed AD would require removing certain HMUs from service and replacing with a serviceable part or modifying the HMU by replacing the CSV assembly, which is an optional terminating action; and would prohibit installing certain HMUs unless the HMU is a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22, R22 Alpha, R22 Beta, R22 Mariner, R44, R44 II, and R66 helicopters. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of helicopters losing a tail rotor blade (TRB) tip cap. This proposed AD would require visually checking and inspecting certain part-numbered and serial-numbered TRB tip caps for evidence of corrosion and, depending on the results, removing the corrosion. This proposed AD would also require removing all affected TRBs from service and prohibit installing them on any helicopter. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing revisions to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) for lead and copper under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). In this document, EPA is proposing to require water systems to replace lead service lines, remove the lead trigger level, reduce the lead action level to 0.010 mg/L, and strengthen tap sampling procedures, among other changes that would improve public health protection and simplify the rule relative to the 2021 Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR). This proposed rule provides improvements in the additional following areas: corrosion control treatment, public education and consumer awareness, requirements for small systems, and sampling in schools and child care facilities. EPA's proposed rule aims to address potential disproportionate impacts of lead in drinking water in communities, including through proposed lead service line replacement and public education, among other areas of the proposed rule.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) Model AS907-1-1A and AS907-2- 1G engines. This AD was prompted by reports of compressor surge, including a dual engine compressor surge, during takeoff climb out through a steep temperature inversion, causing a loss of engine thrust control. This AD requires either the replacement of a certain electronic control unit (ECU) software version installed on AS907-1-1A engines with updated software or the replacement of certain ECUs installed on AS907-1-1A engines with ECUs eligible for installation. This AD also requires the replacement of certain ECUs installed on AS907-2-1G engines. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2010-26-05, which applied to certain Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 10 airplanes; Model FAN JET FALCON, FAN JET FALCON SERIES C, D, E, F, and G airplanes; Model MYSTERE-FALCON 20-C5, 20-D5, 20-E5, and 20-F5 airplanes; and all Model MYSTERE-FALCON 200 airplanes; Model FALCON 2000 and FALCON 2000EX airplanes; Model MYSTERE-FALCON 50 and MYSTERE- FALCON 900 airplanes; and Model FALCON 900EX airplanes. AD 2010-26-05 required repetitive inspections for overpressure tightness on the pressurization control regulating valves and, if necessary, replacing the affected valve with a serviceable unit. The FAA issued AD 2010-26- 05 to address failure of the pressurization control regulating valve (overpressure capsule), which will affect the aircraft's overpressure protection. Since the FAA issued AD 2010-26-05, the FAA issued ADs 2021-04-20, 2020-02-13, 2020-03-24, 2020-03-19, 2020-01-13, 2023-05-15, 2023-04-10, 2023-02-13, 2023-04-18, and 2023-04-13 to address the unsafe condition. Therefore, the FAA has determined that AD 2010-26-05 is no longer necessary. Accordingly, AD 2010-26-05 is removed.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to allow certain current and former employees of a land management agency to compete for a permanent position at such agency, when the agency is accepting applications from individuals within the agency's workforce under promotion and internal placement (i.e., merit promotion) procedures; or at any hiring agency when the agency is accepting applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures. The intended effect of this hiring authority is to provide a pathway for current and former land management employees currently serving (or served) under time-limited appointments, who have not received a permanent appointment in the competitive service, to compete for vacant permanent Federal positions in the competitive service under merit promotion procedures.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Deutsche Aircraft GmbH Model 328-100 and -300 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by operator reports of worn and ruptured bonding straps inside the feeder wing tanks and in both outer and inner wing tanks. This proposed AD would require a one-time detailed inspection of each affected part, and applicable corrective actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have developed the Draft National Strategy for Reducing Food Loss and Waste and Recycling Organics ("draft Strategy") to help prevent the loss and waste of food, where possible, increase recycling of food and other organic materials to support a more circular economy for all, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save households and businesses money, and build cleaner and healthier communities. Individually and collectively, the EPA, USDA and FDA are working toward reducing food loss and waste through their Federal interagency collaboration. This Notice provides the public with an opportunity to share input on the draft Strategy, which identifies the EPA, USDA and FDA actions and asks where they can work collaboratively with each other and partners to reduce food loss and waste and recycle organics. These Federal agencies are seeking public comment from diverse partners across the food system. The EPA, USDA and FDA will consider the comments received on this draft Strategy, finalize it, and begin implementation of the final Strategy in 2024.

This final rule amends a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) regarding child restraint systems. The amendments, mandatory in one year, modernize the standard by, among other things, updating CRS owner registration program requirements, labeling requirements on correctly using child restraints, requirements for add-on school bus- specific child restraint systems, and provisions for NHTSA's use of test dummies in NHTSA compliance tests. Amendments mandatory in three years include adding a new FMVSS that updates to standard seat assemblies on which NHTSA tests child restraint systems for compliance with frontal crash performance requirements. This final rule fulfills a mandate of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP- 21) that directs NHTSA to update the standard seat assembly. The purpose of this final rule is to ensure continued effectiveness of child restraint systems in current and future vehicles.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is removing a regulation that addresses the circumstances under which a Veteran is to repay the value of training and rehabilitation supplies and the exceptions where repayment is not required. A prior version of the regulation's authorizing statute contained a provision that permitted VA to require the return or repayment of books, supplies, or equipment if a Veteran failed to complete a course of vocational rehabilitation due to fault on their part. However, because the authorizing statute no longer contains that provision, and because there is no statutory authority allowing VA to require reimbursement of books, supplies, or equipment under any circumstance where a Veteran fails to complete a course of vocational rehabilitation, VA is removing the governing regulation.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the northern distinct population segment (DPS) of the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii), an amphibian occurring in central and northern California, and the southern DPS of the western spadefoot, occurring in southern California and northwestern Mexico, as threatened DPSs under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This determination serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the western spadefoot range-wide. After a review of the best scientific and commercial information available, we find that listing the northern and southern DPSs of the western spadefoot as threatened is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the northern and southern DPSs of the western spadefoot as threatened DPSs with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add the northern DPS and southern DPS of the western spadefoot to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the two DPSs. Due to the current lack of data sufficient to perform required analyses, we conclude that the designation of critical habitat for the northern DPS and southern DPS of the western spadefoot is not determinable at this time.

NMFS proposes 2024 and 2025 harvest specifications, apportionments, and prohibited species catch allowances for the groundfish fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. This action is necessary to establish harvest limits for groundfish during the 2024 and 2025 fishing years and to accomplish the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (FMP). The 2024 harvest specifications supersede those previously set in the final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications, and the 2025 harvest specifications will be superseded in early 2025 when the final 2025 and 2026 harvest specifications are published. The intended effect of this action is to conserve and manage the groundfish resources in the BSAI in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a Report and Order implementing the Safe Connections Act of 2022 (Safe Connections Act or SCA), taking significant steps to improve access to communications services for survivors of domestic abuse and related crimes. The Report and Order adopts rules to implement the line separation provisions in the Safe Connections Act that allow survivors to separate a mobile phone line from an abuser. To protect the privacy of calls and texts to hotlines, the Report and Order requires covered providers and wireline, fixed wireless, and fixed satellite providers of voice service to: omit from consumer-facing logs of calls and text messages any records of calls or text messages to covered hotlines in the central database established by the Commission; and maintain internal records of calls and text messages excluded from consumer- facing logs of calls and text messages. The Report and Order also designates the Lifeline program to support emergency communications service for survivors that have pursued the line separation process and are experiencing financial hardship.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") to improve the governance of clearing agencies registered with the Commission ("registered clearing agencies") by reducing the likelihood that conflicts of interest may influence the board of directors or equivalent governing body ("board") of a registered clearing agency. The rules identify certain responsibilities of the board, increase transparency into board governance, and, more generally, improve the alignment of incentives among owners and participants of a registered clearing agency. In support of these objectives, the rules establish new requirements for board and committee composition, independent directors, management of conflicts of interest, and board oversight.

FinCEN is amending the beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule (the "Reporting Rule") to extend the filing deadline for certain BOI reports. Under the Reporting Rule prior to this amendment, entities created or registered on or after the rule's effective date of January 1, 2024, had to file initial BOI reports with FinCEN within 30 calendar days of notice of their creation or registration. This amendment extends that filing deadline from 30 calendar days to 90 calendar days for entities created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, to give those entities additional time to understand the new reporting obligation and collect the necessary information to complete their filings. Entities created or registered on or after January 1, 2025, will continue to have 30 calendar days to file their BOI reports with FinCEN.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), determine threatened species status under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, for the distinct population segment (DPS) of the North American wolverine (Gulo gulo luscus) occurring in the contiguous United States. This rule adds the contiguous U.S. DPS of the North American wolverine to the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. We are also issuing an interim rule under the authority of section 4(d) of the Act (an "interim 4(d) rule") that provides the prohibitions, and exceptions to those prohibitions, necessary and advisable for the conservation of the contiguous U.S. DPS of the North American wolverine.

On November 27, 2020, we, NMFS, published in the Federal Register a proposal to designate 17 island units of critical habitat in the Pacific Islands Region for 7 Indo-Pacific coral species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Based on public comments and new information regarding the interpretation of the records of the listed corals and application to critical habitat, a substantial revision of the proposed rule is warranted. Accordingly, we are withdrawing the 2020 proposed rule and publishing this new proposed rule. We propose to designate critical habitat for five of the seven coral species that were addressed in the 2020 proposed rule: Acropora globiceps, Acropora retusa, Acropora speciosa, Euphyllia paradivisa, and Isopora crateriformis. Proposed critical habitat includes 16 island units encompassing approximately 251 square kilometers ((km\2\); 97 square miles (mi\2\)) of marine habitat. Several areas are ineligible for critical habitat because of final Department of Defense Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans that we have determined will benefit the listed corals. We have considered economic, national security, and other relevant impacts of the proposed designations, but are not proposing to exclude any areas from the critical habitat designations due to anticipated impacts.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) are proposing to classify certain types of wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials and/or other chemicals (unclassified, preamendments devices) as solid wound dressings; wound dressings formulated as a gel, cream, or ointment; and liquid wound washes. FDA currently regulates these unclassified devices as devices requiring premarket notification (510(k) requirements), with the product codes FRO, GER, MGP, MGQ, and EFQ, but FDA intends to create new product codes for these proposed classifications upon finalization of this classification action. FDA is proposing to classify certain wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials with a high level of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) concern (i.e., medically important antimicrobials) into class III. In addition, FDA is proposing to classify certain wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials with a medium or low level of AMR concern and/or other chemicals, into class II (subject to special controls and 510(k) requirements).

The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is issuing this Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) to invite applications from State and local governments for awards under the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (the "Act"). An award recipient will receive payment if a specified outcome of the social impact partnership project is achieved as determined by the project's independent evaluator. The payment to the Awardee must be less than or equal to the value of the outcome to the federal government over a period not exceeding ten years from the date implementation commences. Awards made under this NOFA will be administered by Treasury or by another federal agency with expertise in the social benefits addressed in the proposed project. Treasury expects to award up to approximately $40.9 million in such competitive project grants under this NOFA. Treasury will prioritize projects that directly benefit children in order to meet the statutory threshold that 50 percent of awarded funds be used on awards that directly benefit children. In addition, State and local governments receiving project grants will be eligible to receive a grant for up to 15 percent of the project grant amount to pay for all or a portion of the cost of a statutorily required independent evaluation, which will be paid regardless of whether outcomes have been met. Treasury expects up to approximately $6.1 million to be available to pay for the costs of independent evaluations under this NOFA.

The Board and the Bureau (collectively, the Agencies) are publishing final rules amending the official interpretations and commentary for the Agencies' regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended TILA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions be adjusted annually by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Under regulations adopted by the Agencies, if there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Agencies will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. Additionally, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted because the CPI-W decreased, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2023, the exemption threshold will increase from $66,400 to $69,500 effective January 1, 2024. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Consumer Leasing Act's threshold for exempt consumer leases, the Agencies are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Consumer Leasing Act elsewhere in the Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including non- weatherized oil-fired furnaces ("NWOFs"), mobile home oil-fired furnaces ("MHOFs"), weatherized gas furnaces ("WGFs"), weatherized oil-fired furnaces ("WOFs"), and electric furnaces ("EFs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically review its existing standards to determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notification of proposed determination ("NOPD"), DOE has initially determined that amended energy conservation standards for EFs, NWOFs, MHOFs, WOFs, and WGFs do not need to be amended. DOE requests comment on this proposed determination and the associated analyses and results.

The OCC, the Board, and the Bureau are finalizing amendments to the official interpretations for their regulations that implement section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Section 129H of TILA establishes special appraisal requirements for "higher-risk mortgages," termed "higher-priced mortgage loans" or "HPMLs" in the agencies' regulations. The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) jointly issued final rules implementing these requirements, effective January 18, 2014. The Agencies' rules exempted, among other loan types, transactions of $25,000 or less, and required that this loan amount be adjusted annually based on any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. Additionally, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted because the CPI-W decreased, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the CPI-W in effect as of June 1, 2023, the exemption threshold will increase from $31,000 to $32,400, effective January 1, 2024.

Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2023, the exemption threshold will increase from $66,400 to $69,500 effective January 1, 2024. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Truth in Lending Act's threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions, the Agencies are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act elsewhere in the Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register.

The Board of Governors (Board) is publishing a final rule that applies an inflation adjustment to the threshold for total consolidated assets in Regulation I. Federal Reserve Bank (Reserve Bank) stockholders that have total consolidated assets above the threshold receive a different dividend rate on their Reserve Bank stock than stockholders with total consolidated assets at or below the threshold. The Federal Reserve Act requires that the Board annually adjust the total consolidated asset threshold to reflect the change in the Gross Domestic Product Price Index, published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Based on the change in the Gross Domestic Product Price Index as of September 28, 2023, the total consolidated asset threshold will be $12,517,000,000 through December 31, 2024.

The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2024. The annual indexation of these amounts is required notwithstanding the Board's action in March 2020 of setting all reserve requirement ratios to zero. The reserve requirement exemption amount for 2023 will remain $36.1 million, unchanged for 2024, consistent with the Federal Reserve Act (the "Act"). The Board is amending Regulation D to set the amount of the low reserve tranche at $644.0 million (decreased from $691.7 million in 2023). The adjustment to the low reserve tranche is derived using a statutory formula specified in the Act. The annual indexation of the reserve requirement exemption amount and low reserve tranche is required by statute but will not affect depository institutions' reserve requirements, which will remain zero.

The FDIC is adopting a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF or Fund) arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, CA, and Signature Bank, New York, NY. The FDIC will collect the $16.3 billion special assessment at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points, multiplied by an insured depository institution's (IDI) estimated uninsured deposits, reported for the quarter that ended December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the IDI, or for IDIs that are part of a holding company with one or more subsidiary IDIs, at the banking organization level. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods, although the collection period may change due to updates to the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination or if assessments collected change due to corrective amendments to the amount of uninsured deposits reported for the December 31, 2022, reporting period.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving adoptions, repeals, and amendments to the New Jersey State Implementation Plan (SIP) concerning exemptions to improve resiliency during emergency situations, updates to hazardous air pollutant (HAP) reporting thresholds, updates to the certification and submission of emission statements, and the addition of Federal New Source Review (NSR) requirements for fine particles (PM<INF>2.5</INF>). The intended effect of New Jersey's revisions are to enable government and business entities to be more resilient during and following disruptions from natural and human-caused disasters; update HAP unit risk factors and reference concentrations to reflect current research, scientific, and technological advancements; update provisions to require the reporting of PM<INF>2.5</INF> and ammonia (NH3) emissions at the source level and update the electronic reporting of emission statements to adapt with advancements and Federal requirements; and conform the State's rules on air permits to the EPA's NSR requirements for PM<INF>2.5</INF> to ensure a source does not adversely impact the EPA-established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Other revisions New Jersey made, which the EPA is approving with this notice of final rulemaking, will conform administrative penalties to the approved rules and correct errors and inconsistencies throughout the State's SIP. This action is being taken in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposed to approve this rule on September 28, 2023, and received no comments.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to grant a treatability variance from the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) treatment standards for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for approximately 2,000 gallons of mixed low-activity waste from the Hanford Site in Washington State. The petitioner demonstrated that treatment of the waste to the specified standard is technically inappropriate, and the treatment variance is sufficient to minimize threats to human health and the environment posed by land disposal of the waste. If the variance is granted, the waste will be stabilized subject to specified conditions, and disposed at EnergySolutions in Clive, Utah and/or Waste Control Specialists in Andrews County, Texas. The variance would allow DOE, Washington, and EPA to evaluate the regulatory pathways by which separation, pretreatment, stabilization, and offsite disposal could be implemented for other Hanford mixed low-activity waste.

The intent of Amendment 24 is to clarify the technical process for reviewing updates to the models used to determine the Chinook salmon abundance threshold that may trigger additional management measures to limit the impact of ocean salmon fisheries on Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW). The whales are listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Chinook salmon, some of which are listed as threatened under the ESA, are their preferred prey. This action is administrative in nature and does not change the formula for calculating the threshold or the fishery management responses currently described in the Salmon FMP.

The Federal Trade Commission commences a rulemaking to promulgate a trade regulation rule entitled "Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees," which would prohibit unfair or deceptive practices relating to fees for goods or services, specifically, misrepresenting the total costs of goods and services by omitting mandatory fees from advertised prices and misrepresenting the nature and purpose of fees. The Commission finds these unfair or deceptive practices relating to fees to be prevalent based on prior enforcement, the comments it received in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, and other information discussed in this proposal. The Commission now solicits written comment, data, and arguments concerning the utility and scope of the trade regulation rule proposed in this notice of proposed rulemaking to prevent the identified unfair or deceptive practices.

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) amends its rules to retain the radiotelephone requirements for vessels subject to the current Great Lakes Agreement (GLA or Agreement). The GLA is a treaty between the United States and Canada. In relevant part, the GLA established requirements regarding the usage and maintenance of radiocommunications equipment for safety purposes aboard certain vessels navigating on the Great Lakes. Pursuant to Canada's notice of termination on November 2, 2022, the GLA will cease to be effective on November 2, 2023. As a result, the FCC takes expedited action in this order to amend subpart T and certain other parts of the Commission's rules to remove the references to the GLA and maintain the applicability of rules in the Great Lakes.

NMFS issues this final rule to revise the monitoring requirements for pot gear catcher/processors (CPs) participating in Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) groundfish fisheries. This action is needed to address management challenges created by observer data collection errors that have impacted catch estimates. This action improves observer data collection by requiring participating CPs to carry a Level 2 observer and comply with pre-cruise meeting notifications and by requiring certification and testing standards for participants choosing any of the following voluntary monitoring options: providing observer sampling stations, installing motion- compensated platform and flow scales, and carrying additional observers on the vessel. Additionally, this action changes the location of existing monitoring regulations for longline CPs and halibut deck sorting by moving them under a single, new subpart within the regulations. This action promotes the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson- Stevens Act), the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the BSAI Management Area (BSAI FMP), and other applicable laws.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) Model PW307A and PW307D engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a root cause analysis of an event involving an uncontained failure of a high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling and an aborted takeoff. This proposed AD would require removing from service and replacing certain HPT disks and would also prohibit installing certain HPT disks on any engine, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The National Science Foundation, on behalf of the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology (SOST), requests input from all interested parties to inform the development of a National Ocean Biodiversity Strategy (Strategy), covering the genetic lineages, species, habitats, and ecosystems of United States (U.S.) ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes waters. The Strategy will strengthen the knowledge foundation and coordination on which federal agencies and other parties can align priorities and investments toward more cost-effective and successful solutions to the increasing challenges that require information on biodiversity and living resources. The Strategy will align research and monitoring on ocean life for safe and sustainable management, conservation, development, and climate solutions; and improve delivery of biodiversity information to support wise management and the growing ocean economy. Through this request for information (RFI), SOST seeks input on the foundational elements of a Strategy for delivering needed knowledge and implementing effective stewardship of ocean life. Those elements will include actions federal agencies should take to collect, coordinate, and deliver information for policy, investment, development, and management, to better align ocean biodiversity investments and policy with societal needs for both use and protection of living resources, ensuring benefits to society across sectors and from local to international levels.

With this notice, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is announcing that it is postponing Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 261 pending further action by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. To comply with an injunction sought and obtained by the State of Louisiana and other plaintiffs from the district court, as well as a subsequent order from the Fifth Circuit, BOEM had previously provided notice of its intent to hold Lease Sale 261 on November 8, 2023. On October 26, 2023, however, the Fifth Circuit stayed the relevant injunction and order pending the merits panel's decision on appeal. To avoid preempting the Fifth Circuit's decision, and avoid duplication of effort, BOEM is now deferring Lease Sale 261 pending disposition of the appeal that is before the Fifth Circuit. Therefore, BOEM will not open and announce bids for the sale on November 8, 2023. BOEM will make future announcements regarding when and under what terms Lease Sale 261 will be held after the Court issues its ruling or provides additional direction to BOEM. Additional information and announcements will be made available on BOEM's website prior to the sale date. See http://www.boem.gov/sale-261.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), establish a nonessential experimental population (NEP) of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the State of Colorado, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The State of Colorado (Colorado Parks and Wildlife or CPW) requested that the Service establish an NEP in conjunction with their State-led gray wolf reintroduction effort. Establishment of this NEP provides for allowable, legal, purposeful, and incidental taking of the gray wolf within a defined NEP area while concurrently providing for the conservation of the species. The geographic boundary of the NEP is the entire State of Colorado. The best available data indicate that reintroduction of the gray wolf into Colorado is biologically feasible and will promote the conservation of the species.

This final rule adjusts the quotas and retention limits and establishes the opening date for the 2024 fishing year for the Atlantic shark commercial fisheries. NMFS also changes the management measures for the 2024 and future fishing years to automatically open the commercial fishing year on January 1 of each year under the base quotas and default retention limits, and increases the default commercial retention limit for the large coastal shark (LCS) fisheries. Quotas are adjusted as required or allowable based on any underharvests from the previous fishing years. The final measures could affect fishing opportunities for commercial shark fishermen in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-21-15, which applies to certain Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 NG, and DA 42 M-NG airplanes. AD 2022-21-15 requires replacing the rudder T-yoke axle with an improved rudder T-yoke axle. Since the FAA issued AD 2022- 21-15, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This proposed AD would require, for certain airplanes, inspecting the rudder steering bracket edge distance and depending on the inspection results, inspecting the T-yoke bolt hole for wear and play, and corrective action if necessary. For certain airplanes this proposed AD would require replacing the rudder T-yoke bolt (axle) with a serviceable part, and applying torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head, and self-locking nut. For all airplanes this proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head for proper alignment and the self- locking nut for proper installation and corrective action if necessary. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The proposed information collection request (ICR) renewal described below will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA). The Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is soliciting public comments on this proposed collection renewal. The CSB on its own made additional changes to the survey instructions and survey questions. Additionally, the agency reviewed time considerations for completing the survey and increased the time to complete the survey. Previously, the CSB included information regarding interviews. This information collection request is only for the survey; the information regarding the interviews has been eliminated because the interviews do not fall under the PRA. The purpose of this notice is to allow for an additional 30 days of public comment.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting amendments to certain rules that govern beneficial ownership reporting. The amendments generally shorten the filing deadlines for initial and amended beneficial ownership reports filed on Schedules 13D and 13G. The amendments also clarify the disclosure requirements of Schedule 13D with respect to derivative securities. We also are expanding the timeframe within a given business day by which Schedules 13D and 13G must be filed, and separately requiring that Schedule 13D and 13G filings be made using a structured, machine-readable data language. Further, we discuss how, under the current rules, an investor's use of a cash-settled derivative security may result in the person being treated as a beneficial owner of the class of the reference equity security. We also are providing guidance on the application of the current legal standard found in section 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to certain common types of shareholder engagement activities. Finally, we are making certain technical revisions.

The 2012 decision included segments of the Chattooga Wild and Scenic River in North Carolina, which was not included in the original rule. Consequently, the Forest Service is amending the regulations to reflect the new management direction more accurately for the Chattooga Wild and Scenic River.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final order to revoke the approved method for detecting residues of carbadox, a carcinogenic new animal drug used in swine feed. An approved method is required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as implemented by regulation, to show that no residue of carcinogenic concern from a new animal drug persists in any edible tissue or in any food derived from treated animals. The approved method measures quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QCA) as a marker residue to detect the presence of any residue of carcinogenic concern. QCA is a metabolite of carbadox that FDA has judged does not present a carcinogenic risk. FDA is revoking the approved method for carbadox based on its determination that the method is inadequate to monitor the residue of carcinogenic concern in compliance with FDA's operational definition of no residue because there is no established relationship between the concentration of QCA residues as measured by the approved method and the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern.

AD 2018-03-13 required initial and repetitive visual inspections and fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the main propeller shaft. This AD was prompted by an in-flight failure of a main propeller shaft on a GE Model CT7-9B engine, resulting in the loss of the propeller. This AD requires initial and repetitive visual inspections, FPIs, and ultrasonic inspections (USIs) of the main propeller shaft. Depending on the results of these inspections, this AD requires replacement of the main propeller shaft. As an optional terminating action to these inspections, this AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual (MM) and the operator's existing approved maintenance program or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate incorporating the tasks and reduced inspection thresholds for the main propeller shaft. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This rulemaking adopts as final, without changes, an interim final rule amending the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adjudication regulations to establish presumptive service connection for nine rare respiratory cancers in association with presumed exposure to fine particulate matter. These presumptions apply to Veterans with a qualifying period of service, i.e., who served on active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War (hereinafter Gulf War), from August 2, 1990, onward, as well as in Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan, on or after September 19, 2001, during the Gulf War. This rulemaking implements a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that determined there is sufficient evidence to support these cancers as presumptive based on exposure to fine particulate matter during service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan during certain periods and the subsequent development of the following rare respiratory cancers: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx, SCC of the trachea, adenocarcinoma of the trachea, salivary gland-type tumors of the trachea, adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung, large cell carcinoma of the lung, salivary gland-type tumors of the lung, sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung, and typical and atypical carcinoid of the lung. The intended effect of this rulemaking is to ease the evidentiary burden of this population of Veterans who file claims with VA for these nine rare respiratory cancers.

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed regulatory and statutory amendment to the Wyoming coal program (Wyoming program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). On September 25, 2018 the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council approved a number of revisions to rules governing permitting, operation, and abandonment of Class III underground injection and recovery wells associated with in situ mining of coal. Specifically, the proposed revisions update regulations to be consistent with Environmental Protection Agency Underground Injection Control regulations for class III wells, reorganize the chapter to better correlate with other key Land Quality Division (LQD) regulations and to reference existing LQD regulations and definitions, update regulations to be consistent with other Wyoming regulations pertaining to well construction, well abandonment, and aquifer exemptions, and update regulations to include current best management practices specific to in situ coal mining. This document gives the times and locations that the Wyoming program and this proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are issuing this final rule to comply with a district court order that vacated our November 3, 2020, rule removing the gray wolf (Canis lupus) from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. As a result of the court's order, the regulatory protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), apply to the gray wolf in all or portions of the 45 U.S. States and Mexico where the species was listed at the time we issued the delisting rule. The court order went into effect on February 10, 2022, and is the subject of several consolidated, pending appeals in the Ninth Circuit. While those appeals are pending, the Service is bound by the district court's order. Thus, this final rule implements the court's order by correcting the Code of Federal Regulations and officially reinstating threatened status for gray wolf in Minnesota; endangered status for gray wolf in all or portions of the remaining 44 U.S. States and Mexico where the species was listed prior to our November 2020 delisting rule; critical habitat for gray wolf in Minnesota and Michigan; and the rule promulgated under section 4(d) of the Act for gray wolf in Minnesota. Gray wolves in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, the eastern third of Washington and Oregon, and north-central Utah (collectively, the Northern Rocky Mountains) retain their delisted status and are not affected by this final rule. This rule does not have any effect on the separate listing of the Mexican wolf subspecies (Canis lupus baileyi) as endangered under the Act.

This action proposes special conditions for the Airbus Model A321neo XLR airplane. The airplane will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is associated with flight-envelope protections, in icing and non-icing conditions, that use high-incidence protection and an alpha- floor system to automatically advance throttles when the airplane angle of attack reaches a predetermined value. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend our regulations to revoke the authorization for the use of brominated vegetable oil (BVO) in food. This action is being taken because there is no longer a reasonable certainty of no harm from the continued use of BVO in food.

There are no authorizations for other uses of BVO in food.

The Department of the Army is announcing withdrawal of its Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The August 4, 2023, notice announced the Army's intention to prepare an EIS under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The EIS would have addressed potential environmental effects associated with the congressionally-mandated removal of the Confederate Memorial from Arlington National Cemetery (ANC). The Army determined the congressionally-mandated removal action is a non-discretionary action. There would be no reasonably foreseeable significant impacts from any discretionary elements of the proposed action. An EIS is therefore not needed to inform any decision-making for this action. The Army will prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) to analyze and disclose any effects of the discretionary elements of the proposed action, including how to disassemble the Confederate Memorial.

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 18 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Scallop Fishery off Alaska (Scallop FMP) to the Secretary of Commerce for review. If approved, Amendment 18 would revise timing requirements for Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) reports to allow more flexibility for non-annual assessments and to set scallop harvest specifications less frequently than on an annual basis. This would reduce the burden on staff and provide more time for the development of new stock assessment methods. Amendment 18 is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the Scallop FMP, and other applicable laws.

This document sets forth proposed rules related to certain provisions of the No Surprises Act regarding the Federal independent dispute resolution (IDR) process, which was established as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA). These proposed rules would set forth new requirements relating to the disclosure of information that group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage must include along with the initial payment or notice of denial of payment for certain items and services subject to the surprise billing protections in the No Surprises Act. These proposed rules would also require plans and issuers to communicate information by using claim adjustment reason codes (CARCs) and remittance advice remark codes (RARCs), as specified in guidance, when providing any paper or electronic remittance advice to an entity that does not have a contractual relationship with the plan or issuer. This document also proposes to amend certain requirements related to the open negotiation period preceding the Federal IDR process, the initiation of the Federal IDR process, the Federal IDR dispute eligibility review, and the payment and collection of administrative fees and certified IDR entity fees. This document also proposes to define bundled payment arrangements, amend requirements related to batched items and services, and amend the rules for extensions of timeframes due to extenuating circumstances. Additionally, this document proposes to require plans and issuers to register in the Federal IDR portal.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, in support of efforts to create safe and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), is establishing the Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium ("Consortium"). The Consortium will help equip and empower the collaborative establishment of a new measurement science that will enable the identification of proven, scalable, and interoperable techniques and metrics to promote development and responsible use of safe and trustworthy AI, particularly for the most advanced AI systems, such as the most capable foundation models. NIST invites organizations to provide letters of interest describing technical expertise and products, data, and/or models to enable the development and deployment of safe and trustworthy AI systems through the AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). This notice is the initial step for NIST in collaborating with non-profit organizations, universities, other government agencies, and technology companies to address challenges associated with the development and deployment of AI. Many of these challenges were identified under the Executive Order of October 30, 2023 (The Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence) and the NIST AI RMF Roadmap. Much of this research will center on evaluations of and approaches towards safer, more trustworthy AI systems. Participation in the consortium is open to all interested organizations that can contribute their expertise, products, data, and/or models to the activities of the consortium. Selected participants will be required to enter into a consortium Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with NIST. At NIST's discretion, entities which are not permitted to enter into CRADAs pursuant to law may be allowed to participate in the Consortium pursuant to separate non-CRADA agreement.

On September 6, 2023, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a final temporary rule establishing a special use area of a 0.07 square mile area approximately five miles southeast of the community of Tavernier, on the island of Key Largo, within Federal waters of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) from September 6, 2023, through November 6, 2023. This document extends the temporary special use area an additional 60 days. The special use area prohibits all entry except for restoration activities under a valid Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) permit, continuous transit without interruption, and for law enforcement purposes from November 6, 2023, to January 5, 2024.

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is amending its regulations that govern the payment of checks drawn on the United States Treasury (Treasury checks). The amendments coincide with the development of Fiscal Service's enhanced check post payment processing system, which will provide Treasury check return information to financial institutions more quickly than today. Financial institutions will receive this information through their existing communication channels with the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs), generally prior to the expiration of the time periods in which financial institutions must make Treasury check deposits available for withdrawal as prescribed by Regulation CC, Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks. Accordingly, Fiscal Service is amending its regulations so that, with certain exceptions, a financial institution will be liable if it pays a canceled Treasury check, also known as a payment over cancellation (POC), without waiting to receive the return information that would enable the financial institution to know the check has been canceled.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are reclassifying Mitracarpus polycladus (a plant, no common name) from endangered to threatened (downlist) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This action is based on our evaluation of the best available scientific and commercial information, which indicates that the species' status has improved such that it is not currently in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, but that it is still likely to become so in the foreseeable future. We are also finalizing a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act that provides for the conservation of the species.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (Commission or CPSC) has determined preliminarily that there may be an unreasonable risk of blade-contact injuries associated with table saws. To address this hazard, the Commission proposes a rule under the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) that would establish a performance standard that requires table saws to limit the depth of cut to no more than 3.5 millimeters when a test probe, acting as surrogate for a human finger or other body part, approaches the spinning blade at a rate of 1 meter per second (m/s). The Commission is providing an opportunity for interested parties to present comments on this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPR).

The Community Facilities Loan and Grant program (Community Facilities) of the Rural Housing Service (RHS or the Agency), a Rural Development agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is consolidating the existing regulations that govern Community Facility direct loans and grants, fire and rescue and other small community facilities projects; as well as codifying the Tribal College Initiative, and Economic Impact Initiative grant programs that will incorporate all the necessary loan and grant making information into one streamlined final rule. The result will be an up-to-date comprehensive regulation that will be used to administer the programs. Community Facilities is hosting a virtual listening session to obtain stakeholder input on key proposed areas for changes and/or updates to the proposed consolidated Community Facilities Direct Loan and Grant regulation. This session is open to the public.

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District (Corps), for the re-issuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being to the effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of five species of marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment, incidental to construction associated with the Tillamook South Jetty Repairs in Tillamook Bay, Oregon. The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
