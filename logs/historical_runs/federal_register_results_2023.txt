Source: Federal Register
URL: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/29/2023-28773/airworthiness-directives-leonardo-spa-helicopters
The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Leonardo S.p.a. Model A109E, A109S, AW109SP, A119, and AW119 MKII helicopters. This AD was prompted by multiple reports of excessive axial play on the ball bearing of the lower half of the main rotor (MR) rotating scissor assembly. This AD requires one-time scissor coupling and axial play inspections and repetitive quantitative axial play inspections and, depending on the results, additional inspections and replacing certain parts. This AD also requires reporting information and prohibits installing certain parts unless certain inspections have been accomplished. These requirements are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model MD-11 and MD-11F airplanes equipped with General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2D1F high-bypass turbofan engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a Model MD-11F airplane experiencing an uncommanded deployment of a thrust reverser in-flight at low altitude. This proposed AD would require a one-time detailed inspection of the engine pylon thrust reverser control system wire harnesses and applicable on-condition actions. The proposed AD would also require repetitive detailed inspections and wire integrity tests of the engine thrust reverser control system wire harnesses (in the pylon), junction box and junction box cover, left side and right side thrust reverser electrical harnesses, core (engine compartment) miscellaneous wire harness assembly, and 30 degree bulkhead wire harness assembly; and applicable on-condition actions. This AD also requires reporting. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-19-15, which applies to certain International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1100G series engines; and AD 2023-16-07, which applies to certain IAE LLC Model PW1100G series engines and PW1400G series engines. AD 2022-19-15 requires an angled ultrasonic inspection (AUSI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd- stage disk, and replacement if necessary. AD 2023-16-07 requires an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub (also known as the HPT 1st-stage disk) and HPT 2nd-stage hub (also known as the HPT 2nd-stage disk) for cracks, and replacement if necessary, which is terminating action for AD 2022-19-15. Since the FAA issued those two ADs, an investigation determined an increased risk of powder metal anomalies for all powder metal parts in certain powder metal production campaigns, which are susceptible to failure significantly earlier than previously determined. This proposed AD would retain the AUSI requirement for certain HPT 1st-stage and HPT 2nd-stage hubs from AD 2023-16-07. This proposed AD would also require performing an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage hub, high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7), and HPC 8th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-8) for cracks and replacement if necessary. This proposed AD would also require accelerated replacement of the HPC IBR-7, HPC IBR-8, HPC rear hub, HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 1st-stage air seal, HPT 1st-stage blade retaining plate, HPT 2nd-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage blade retaining plate, and HPT 2nd-stage rear seal. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-27- 09, which applied to certain Airbus Helicopters Model EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2022-27-09 required repetitively inspecting the vibration level on the tail rotor drive shaft and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. AD 2022-27-09 also required reporting information and prohibited installing certain rotor drive shafts unless the inspection was done. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-27- 09, Airbus Helicopters revised its service information to update the procedures for inspecting that vibration level, reduce an allowable vibration level, and clarify when a balance correction may be accomplished. This AD was prompted by the determination that a certain vibration measurement tool was providing unexpected results and therefore the threshold must be revised. This AD continues to require certain actions in AD 2022-27-09 and also revises the procedures for inspecting the vibration level on the tail rotor drive shaft and depending on these results, requires replacing certain parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Washington, through the Department of Ecology on November 12, 2019. The revisions were submitted by Washington in response to EPA's June 12, 2015 "SIP call" in which EPA found a substantially inadequate Washington SIP provision providing affirmative defenses that operate to limit the jurisdiction of the Federal court in an enforcement action related to excess emissions during startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) events. EPA's approval of the SIP revisions removes the substantially inadequate provision which corrects the deficiency identified in the 2015 SSM SIP call. Washington withdrew some portions of the revisions submitted that were not identified in the 2015 SSM SIP call and therefore EPA is not taking final action on those withdrawn portions.

The Coast Guard is updating its user fees for seagoing towing vessels that are 300 gross tons or more and revising user fees for other inspected towing vessels. The Coast Guard is issuing these updates because it is required to establish and maintain a fair fee for its vessel inspection services and to separate the fees for inspection options that involve third-party auditors and surveyors from inspection options that do not involve third parties. Under this final rule, owners and operators of vessels using the Alternate Compliance Program, Streamlined Inspection Program, or the Towing Safety Management System options will pay a lower fee than vessels that use the traditional Coast Guard inspection option.

In place of the baud rate, the Commission sets a bandwidth limitation of 2.8 kilohertz in the respective amateur bands, consistent with the Commission's treatment of other wireless radio services, which also have service-specific bandwidth limitations. This bandwidth limitation will promote continued sharing in these amateur bands.

This policy statement updates FAA policy regarding incentives offered by airport sponsors to air carriers for improved air service. It is longstanding practice for airport operators to offer incentives to air carriers to promote new air service at an airport, including both new air carriers serving the airport and new destinations served. The updated policy statement supersedes the 2010 Air Carrier Incentive Program Guidebook. The policy statement includes general principles to assess whether an airport sponsor's air carrier incentive program (ACIP) complies with the sponsor's FAA grant assurances. It also includes guidance on the permissibility of various specific aspects of an ACIP, as well as ACIP implementation.

This final rule amends FHWA's regulations governing national performance management measures and establishes a method for the measurement and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with transportation (GHG measure). It requires State departments of transportation (State DOT) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) to establish declining carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) targets for the GHG measure and report on progress toward the achievement of those targets. The rule does not mandate how low targets must be. Rather, State DOTs and MPOs have flexibility to set targets that are appropriate for their communities and that work for their respective climate change and other policy priorities, as long as the targets aim to reduce emissions over time. The FHWA will assess whether State DOTs have made significant progress toward achieving their targets.

CMS will use these new enforcement authorities as described in this rule if States fail to comply with the new reporting requirements added by the CAA, 2023 or with Federal Medicaid eligibility redetermination requirements during a timeframe that is generally aligned with the period when States are restoring eligibility and enrollment operations following the end of the Medicaid continuous enrollment condition under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). The new enforcement authorities include requiring States to submit a corrective action plan, suspending disenrollments from Medicaid for procedural reasons, and imposing civil money penalties (CMPs). They also include applying a reduction to the State-specific Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for failure to meet reporting requirements.

In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts changes to its rules aimed at expediting the initial license application processing for satellite operators. The Commission establishes timeframes for placing satellite and earth station applications on public notice, eliminates a procedural rule that prevents consideration of requests for waiver of the International Table of Frequency Allocations, and removes the prohibition on licensed-but-unbuilt systems for non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) operators. Additionally, the Commission creates a new, streamlined processing framework for earth station operators to add satellite points of communication under certain circumstances. Finally, the Commission lays the groundwork for a broader Transparency Initiative led by the Space Bureau to provide clarity and access to applicants when interfacing with the Commission's license application processes and filing system.

This proposed AD was prompted by reports of wear in the combining spill-valve (CSV) assembly of certain hydro-mechanical units (HMUs). This proposed AD would require removing certain HMUs from service and replacing with a serviceable part or modifying the HMU by replacing the CSV assembly, which is an optional terminating action; and would prohibit installing certain HMUs unless the HMU is a serviceable part, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing revisions to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) for lead and copper under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). In this document, EPA is proposing to require water systems to replace lead service lines, remove the lead trigger level, reduce the lead action level to 0.010 mg/L, and strengthen tap sampling procedures, among other changes that would improve public health protection and simplify the rule relative to the 2021 Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR). This proposed rule provides improvements in the additional following areas: corrosion control treatment, public education and consumer awareness, requirements for small systems, and sampling in schools and child care facilities. EPA's proposed rule aims to address potential disproportionate impacts of lead in drinking water in communities, including through proposed lead service line replacement and public education, among other areas of the proposed rule.

The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Honeywell International Inc. (Honeywell) Model AS907-1-1A and AS907-2- 1G engines. This AD was prompted by reports of compressor surge, including a dual engine compressor surge, during takeoff climb out through a steep temperature inversion, causing a loss of engine thrust control. This AD requires either the replacement of a certain electronic control unit (ECU) software version installed on AS907-1-1A engines with updated software or the replacement of certain ECUs installed on AS907-1-1A engines with ECUs eligible for installation. This AD also requires the replacement of certain ECUs installed on AS907-2-1G engines. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The FAA is removing Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2010-26-05, which applied to certain Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 10 airplanes; Model FAN JET FALCON, FAN JET FALCON SERIES C, D, E, F, and G airplanes; Model MYSTERE-FALCON 20-C5, 20-D5, 20-E5, and 20-F5 airplanes; and all Model MYSTERE-FALCON 200 airplanes; Model FALCON 2000 and FALCON 2000EX airplanes; Model MYSTERE-FALCON 50 and MYSTERE- FALCON 900 airplanes; and Model FALCON 900EX airplanes. AD 2010-26-05 required repetitive inspections for overpressure tightness on the pressurization control regulating valves and, if necessary, replacing the affected valve with a serviceable unit. The FAA issued AD 2010-26- 05 to address failure of the pressurization control regulating valve (overpressure capsule), which will affect the aircraft's overpressure protection. Since the FAA issued AD 2010-26-05, the FAA issued ADs 2021-04-20, 2020-02-13, 2020-03-24, 2020-03-19, 2020-01-13, 2023-05-15, 2023-04-10, 2023-02-13, 2023-04-18, and 2023-04-13 to address the unsafe condition. Therefore, the FAA has determined that AD 2010-26-05 is no longer necessary. Accordingly, AD 2010-26-05 is removed.

This final rule amends a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) regarding child restraint systems. The amendments, mandatory in one year, modernize the standard by, among other things, updating CRS owner registration program requirements, labeling requirements on correctly using child restraints, requirements for add-on school bus- specific child restraint systems, and provisions for NHTSA's use of test dummies in NHTSA compliance tests. Amendments mandatory in three years include adding a new FMVSS that updates to standard seat assemblies on which NHTSA tests child restraint systems for compliance with frontal crash performance requirements. This final rule fulfills a mandate of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP- 21) that directs NHTSA to update the standard seat assembly. The purpose of this final rule is to ensure continued effectiveness of child restraint systems in current and future vehicles.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is removing a regulation that addresses the circumstances under which a Veteran is to repay the value of training and rehabilitation supplies and the exceptions where repayment is not required. A prior version of the regulation's authorizing statute contained a provision that permitted VA to require the return or repayment of books, supplies, or equipment if a Veteran failed to complete a course of vocational rehabilitation due to fault on their part. However, because the authorizing statute no longer contains that provision, and because there is no statutory authority allowing VA to require reimbursement of books, supplies, or equipment under any circumstance where a Veteran fails to complete a course of vocational rehabilitation, VA is removing the governing regulation.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to list the northern distinct population segment (DPS) of the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii), an amphibian occurring in central and northern California, and the southern DPS of the western spadefoot, occurring in southern California and northwestern Mexico, as threatened DPSs under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This determination serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the western spadefoot range-wide. After a review of the best scientific and commercial information available, we find that listing the northern and southern DPSs of the western spadefoot as threatened is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the northern and southern DPSs of the western spadefoot as threatened DPSs with a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act ("4(d) rule"). If we finalize this rule as proposed, it would add the northern DPS and southern DPS of the western spadefoot to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the two DPSs. Due to the current lack of data sufficient to perform required analyses, we conclude that the designation of critical habitat for the northern DPS and southern DPS of the western spadefoot is not determinable at this time.

NMFS proposes 2024 and 2025 harvest specifications, apportionments, and prohibited species catch allowances for the groundfish fisheries of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. This action is necessary to establish harvest limits for groundfish during the 2024 and 2025 fishing years and to accomplish the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (FMP). The 2024 harvest specifications supersede those previously set in the final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications, and the 2025 harvest specifications will be superseded in early 2025 when the final 2025 and 2026 harvest specifications are published. The intended effect of this action is to conserve and manage the groundfish resources in the BSAI in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).

The Report and Order adopts rules to implement the line separation provisions in the Safe Connections Act that allow survivors to separate a mobile phone line from an abuser. To protect the privacy of calls and texts to hotlines, the Report and Order requires covered providers and wireline, fixed wireless, and fixed satellite providers of voice service to: omit from consumer-facing logs of calls and text messages any records of calls or text messages to covered hotlines in the central database established by the Commission; and maintain internal records of calls and text messages excluded from consumer- facing logs of calls and text messages. The Report and Order also designates the Lifeline program to support emergency communications service for survivors that have pursued the line separation process and are experiencing financial hardship.

The rules identify certain responsibilities of the board, increase transparency into board governance, and, more generally, improve the alignment of incentives among owners and participants of a registered clearing agency. In support of these objectives, the rules establish new requirements for board and committee composition, independent directors, management of conflicts of interest, and board oversight.

The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-07- 05, which applied to all Airbus SAS Model A318 series airplanes; Model A319-111, -112, -113, -114, -115, -131, -132, and -133 airplanes; Model A320-211, -212, -214, -216, -231, -232, and -233 airplanes; and Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, and -232 airplanes. AD 2019-07-05 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the 10VU rack fitting lugs and repair of any cracking. This AD continues to require the requirements of AD 2019-07-05, with reduced compliance times and removes airplanes having a certain modification from the applicability. This AD was prompted by a determination that certain repetitive inspection intervals need to be revised. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This final rule implements regulations for Amendment 32 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. The regulations include a suite of changes to non-trawl sector area management measures seaward of California and Oregon. The purpose of Amendment 32 is to provide fishing access to healthy groundfish stocks for non-trawl groundfish fisheries and the directed commercial Pacific halibut fishery while still meeting the conservation objectives of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. In addition, this final rule implements minor administrative revisions to the regulations to correct the name of the Cordell Bank Groundfish Conservation Area, amend the description of the Cordell Bank Groundfish Conservation Area, add new regulatory definitions for different types of fishing bait, and add new exemptions to Vessel Monitoring System reporting requirements.

Under this proposed rule, when tenants who reside in public housing or in properties receiving project-based rental assistance (PBRA) face eviction for nonpayment of rent, public housing agencies (PHAs) and owners would need to provide those tenants with written notification at least 30 days prior to the commencement of a formal judicial eviction procedure for lease termination. For purposes of this proposed rule, PBRA includes projects in the following programs: Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance, Section 202/162 Project Assistance Contract, Section 202 Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC), Section 811 PRAC, Section 811 Project Rental Assistance Program (811 PRA), and Senior Preservation Rental Assistance Contract Projects (SPRAC). This proposed rule would curtail preventable and unnecessary evictions by providing tenants with time and information to help cure nonpayment violations.

NMFS issues regulations to implement Amendment 51 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic Region, as prepared and submitted by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council. For snowy grouper, this final rule revises the sector annual catch limits (ACLs), commercial seasonal quotas, recreational fishing season, and recreational accountability measures. In addition, Amendment 51 revises the overfishing limit for snowy grouper, the acceptable biological catch, annual optimum yield (OY), and sector allocations of the total ACL. The purpose of this final rule and Amendment 51 is to end overfishing of snowy grouper, rebuild the stock, and achieve OY while minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse economic impacts on fishing communities.

On November 27, 2020, we, NMFS, published in the Federal Register a proposal to designate 17 island units of critical habitat in the Pacific Islands Region for 7 Indo-Pacific coral species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Based on public comments and new information regarding the interpretation of the records of the listed corals and application to critical habitat, a substantial revision of the proposed rule is warranted. Accordingly, we are withdrawing the 2020 proposed rule and publishing this new proposed rule. We propose to designate critical habitat for five of the seven coral species that were addressed in the 2020 proposed rule: Acropora globiceps, Acropora retusa, Acropora speciosa, Euphyllia paradivisa, and Isopora crateriformis. Proposed critical habitat includes 16 island units encompassing approximately 251 square kilometers ((km\2\); 97 square miles (mi\2\)) of marine habitat. Several areas are ineligible for critical habitat because of final Department of Defense Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans that we have determined will benefit the listed corals. We have considered economic, national security, and other relevant impacts of the proposed designations, but are not proposing to exclude any areas from the critical habitat designations due to anticipated impacts.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Agency, or we) are proposing to classify certain types of wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials and/or other chemicals (unclassified, preamendments devices) as solid wound dressings; wound dressings formulated as a gel, cream, or ointment; and liquid wound washes. FDA currently regulates these unclassified devices as devices requiring premarket notification (510(k) requirements), with the product codes FRO, GER, MGP, MGQ, and EFQ, but FDA intends to create new product codes for these proposed classifications upon finalization of this classification action. FDA is proposing to classify certain wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials with a high level of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) concern (i.e., medically important antimicrobials) into class III. In addition, FDA is proposing to classify certain wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials with a medium or low level of AMR concern and/or other chemicals, into class II (subject to special controls and 510(k) requirements).

The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is issuing this Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) to invite applications from State and local governments for awards under the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (the "Act"). An award recipient will receive payment if a specified outcome of the social impact partnership project is achieved as determined by the project's independent evaluator. The payment to the Awardee must be less than or equal to the value of the outcome to the federal government over a period not exceeding ten years from the date implementation commences. Awards made under this NOFA will be administered by Treasury or by another federal agency with expertise in the social benefits addressed in the proposed project. Treasury expects to award up to approximately $40.9 million in such competitive project grants under this NOFA. Treasury will prioritize projects that directly benefit children in order to meet the statutory threshold that 50 percent of awarded funds be used on awards that directly benefit children. In addition, State and local governments receiving project grants will be eligible to receive a grant for up to 15 percent of the project grant amount to pay for all or a portion of the cost of a statutorily required independent evaluation, which will be paid regardless of whether outcomes have been met. Treasury expects up to approximately $6.1 million to be available to pay for the costs of independent evaluations under this NOFA.

BSEE proposes to incorporate documents by reference (Production Measurement Industry Standards and Safety Industry Standards, including one International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission standard) into the regulations governing oil, gas, and sulfur operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Incorporation of these documents by reference would provide industry with up-to-date, minimum requirements for measuring oil and gas production volumes and enhancing safety. This would reduce uncertainty in the measurement of oil and gas production and update the minimum standards in the safety regulations.

The Board and the Bureau (collectively, the Agencies) are publishing final rules amending the official interpretations and commentary for the Agencies' regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended TILA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions be adjusted annually by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Under regulations adopted by the Agencies, if there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Agencies will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. Additionally, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted because the CPI-W decreased, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2023, the exemption threshold will increase from $66,400 to $69,500 effective January 1, 2024. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Consumer Leasing Act's threshold for exempt consumer leases, the Agencies are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Consumer Leasing Act elsewhere in the Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended ("EPCA"), prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and certain commercial and industrial equipment, including non- weatherized oil-fired furnaces ("NWOFs"), mobile home oil-fired furnaces ("MHOFs"), weatherized gas furnaces ("WGFs"), weatherized oil-fired furnaces ("WOFs"), and electric furnaces ("EFs"). EPCA also requires the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to periodically review its existing standards to determine whether more-stringent, amended standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would result in significant energy savings. In this notification of proposed determination ("NOPD"), DOE has initially determined that amended energy conservation standards for EFs, NWOFs, MHOFs, WOFs, and WGFs do not need to be amended. DOE requests comment on this proposed determination and the associated analyses and results.

The OCC, the Board, and the Bureau are finalizing amendments to the official interpretations for their regulations that implement section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Section 129H of TILA establishes special appraisal requirements for "higher-risk mortgages," termed "higher-priced mortgage loans" or "HPMLs" in the agencies' regulations. The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) jointly issued final rules implementing these requirements, effective January 18, 2014. The Agencies' rules exempted, among other loan types, transactions of $25,000 or less, and required that this loan amount be adjusted annually based on any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. Additionally, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted because the CPI-W decreased, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the CPI-W in effect as of June 1, 2023, the exemption threshold will increase from $31,000 to $32,400, effective January 1, 2024.

The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2024. The annual indexation of these amounts is required notwithstanding the Board's action in March 2020 of setting all reserve requirement ratios to zero. The reserve requirement exemption amount for 2023 will remain $36.1 million, unchanged for 2024, consistent with the Federal Reserve Act (the "Act"). The Board is amending Regulation D to set the amount of the low reserve tranche at $644.0 million (decreased from $691.7 million in 2023). The adjustment to the low reserve tranche is derived using a statutory formula specified in the Act. The annual indexation of the reserve requirement exemption amount and low reserve tranche is required by statute but will not affect depository institutions' reserve requirements, which will remain zero.

The FDIC is adopting a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF or Fund) arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, CA, and Signature Bank, New York, NY. The FDIC will collect the $16.3 billion special assessment at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points, multiplied by an insured depository institution's (IDI) estimated uninsured deposits, reported for the quarter that ended December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the IDI, or for IDIs that are part of a holding company with one or more subsidiary IDIs, at the banking organization level. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods, although the collection period may change due to updates to the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination or if assessments collected change due to corrective amendments to the amount of uninsured deposits reported for the December 31, 2022, reporting period.

The Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments (CZARA) directs states and territories with coastal zone management programs previously approved under section 306 of the Coastal Zone Management Act to develop and implement coastal nonpoint programs, which must be submitted to the Federal agencies for approval. Prior to making such a finding, NOAA and the EPA invite public input on the two agencies' rationale for this proposed finding.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to grant a treatability variance from the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) treatment standards for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for approximately 2,000 gallons of mixed low-activity waste from the Hanford Site in Washington State. The petitioner demonstrated that treatment of the waste to the specified standard is technically inappropriate, and the treatment variance is sufficient to minimize threats to human health and the environment posed by land disposal of the waste. If the variance is granted, the waste will be stabilized subject to specified conditions, and disposed at EnergySolutions in Clive, Utah and/or Waste Control Specialists in Andrews County, Texas. The variance would allow DOE, Washington, and EPA to evaluate the regulatory pathways by which separation, pretreatment, stabilization, and offsite disposal could be implemented for other Hanford mixed low-activity waste.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is adopting risk-based capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are significantly engaged in insurance activities. This risk-based capital framework, termed the Building Block Approach, adjusts and aggregates existing legal entity capital requirements to determine enterprise-wide capital requirements. The final rule also contains a risk-based capital requirement excluding insurance activities, in compliance with section 171 of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Board also is adopting a reporting form FR Q-1 related to the Building Block Approach. The capital requirements and associated reporting form meet statutory mandates and will help to prevent the economic and consumer impacts resulting from the failure of organizations engaged in banking and insurance.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 24 to the Pacific Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan (Salmon FMP) to the Secretary of Commerce for review. The intent of Amendment 24 is to clarify the technical process for reviewing updates to the models used to determine the Chinook salmon abundance threshold that may trigger additional management measures to limit the impact of ocean salmon fisheries on Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW). The whales are listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Chinook salmon, some of which are listed as threatened under the ESA, are their preferred prey. This action is administrative in nature and does not change the formula for calculating the threshold or the fishery management responses currently described in the Salmon FMP.

NMFS issues this final rule to revise the monitoring requirements for pot gear catcher/processors (CPs) participating in Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) groundfish fisheries. This action is needed to address management challenges created by observer data collection errors that have impacted catch estimates. This action improves observer data collection by requiring participating CPs to carry a Level 2 observer and comply with pre-cruise meeting notifications and by requiring certification and testing standards for participants choosing any of the following voluntary monitoring options: providing observer sampling stations, installing motion- compensated platform and flow scales, and carrying additional observers on the vessel. Additionally, this action changes the location of existing monitoring regulations for longline CPs and halibut deck sorting by moving them under a single, new subpart within the regulations. This action promotes the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson- Stevens Act), the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the BSAI Management Area (BSAI FMP), and other applicable laws.

The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Pratt & Whitney Canada Corp. (P&WC) Model PW307A and PW307D engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a root cause analysis of an event involving an uncontained failure of a high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk that resulted in high-energy debris penetrating the engine cowling and an aborted takeoff. This proposed AD would require removing from service and replacing certain HPT disks and would also prohibit installing certain HPT disks on any engine, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

NMFS proposes to implement management measures described in Amendment 56 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP) as prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council). If implemented for gag in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), this proposed rule would revise catch levels, recreational accountability measures (AMs), and the recreational fishing season. In addition, Amendment 56 would establish a rebuilding plan for the overfished stock, revise stock status determination criteria, and sector harvest allocations. The purpose of this action is to implement a rebuilding plan for gag and revised management measures to end overfishing and rebuild the stock.

The Strategy will strengthen the knowledge foundation and coordination on which federal agencies and other parties can align priorities and investments toward more cost-effective and successful solutions to the increasing challenges that require information on biodiversity and living resources. The Strategy will align research and monitoring on ocean life for safe and sustainable management, conservation, development, and climate solutions; and improve delivery of biodiversity information to support wise management and the growing ocean economy. Through this request for information (RFI), SOST seeks input on the foundational elements of a Strategy for delivering needed knowledge and implementing effective stewardship of ocean life. Those elements will include actions federal agencies should take to collect, coordinate, and deliver information for policy, investment, development, and management, to better align ocean biodiversity investments and policy with societal needs for both use and protection of living resources, ensuring benefits to society across sectors and from local to international levels.

With this notice, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is announcing that it is postponing Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 261 pending further action by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. To comply with an injunction sought and obtained by the State of Louisiana and other plaintiffs from the district court, as well as a subsequent order from the Fifth Circuit, BOEM had previously provided notice of its intent to hold Lease Sale 261 on November 8, 2023. On October 26, 2023, however, the Fifth Circuit stayed the relevant injunction and order pending the merits panel's decision on appeal. To avoid preempting the Fifth Circuit's decision, and avoid duplication of effort, BOEM is now deferring Lease Sale 261 pending disposition of the appeal that is before the Fifth Circuit. Therefore, BOEM will not open and announce bids for the sale on November 8, 2023. BOEM will make future announcements regarding when and under what terms Lease Sale 261 will be held after the Court issues its ruling or provides additional direction to BOEM. Additional information and announcements will be made available on BOEM's website prior to the sale date. See http://www.boem.gov/sale-261.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), establish a nonessential experimental population (NEP) of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) in the State of Colorado, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The State of Colorado (Colorado Parks and Wildlife or CPW) requested that the Service establish an NEP in conjunction with their State-led gray wolf reintroduction effort. Establishment of this NEP provides for allowable, legal, purposeful, and incidental taking of the gray wolf within a defined NEP area while concurrently providing for the conservation of the species. The geographic boundary of the NEP is the entire State of Colorado. The best available data indicate that reintroduction of the gray wolf into Colorado is biologically feasible and will promote the conservation of the species.

The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-21-15, which applies to certain Diamond Aircraft Industries GmbH (DAI) Model DA 42, DA 42 NG, and DA 42 M-NG airplanes. AD 2022-21-15 requires replacing the rudder T-yoke axle with an improved rudder T-yoke axle. Since the FAA issued AD 2022- 21-15, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) superseded its mandatory continuing airworthiness information (MCAI) to correct an unsafe condition on these products. This proposed AD would require, for certain airplanes, inspecting the rudder steering bracket edge distance and depending on the inspection results, inspecting the T-yoke bolt hole for wear and play, and corrective action if necessary. For certain airplanes this proposed AD would require replacing the rudder T-yoke bolt (axle) with a serviceable part, and applying torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head, and self-locking nut. For all airplanes this proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the torque seal marks on the rudder T-yoke bolt head for proper alignment and the self- locking nut for proper installation and corrective action if necessary. This proposed AD would also prohibit the installation of affected parts. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published a rule in the Federal Register on October 17, 2023, that amended the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to revise the existing Validated End- User (VEU) list for the People's Republic of China (PRC) for Samsung China Semiconductor Co. Ltd. and SK hynix Semiconductor (China) Ltd. That rule inadvertently omitted two amendments to the list of VEUs, which resulted in failure to add a word to the description of eligible items for SK Hynix Semiconductor (China) Ltd.; as well as the failure to remove the entry for SK hynix Semiconductor (Wuxi), which was necessary because SK hynix Semiconductor (Wuxi) recently merged with SK hynix Semiconductor (China) Ltd. This rule corrects both omissions.

While promulgating the final waiver, FHWA announced that it would conduct biannual RFIs to receive information on the status of the EV charger industry. Requests for comment include, but are not limited to, the number of chargers recently produced by EV charger manufacturers, projections on chargers expected to be produced, and the number of EV chargers recently purchased by recipients of Federal financial assistance and projected to be purchased by recipients of Federal financial assistance in the near future.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") is adopting amendments to certain rules that govern beneficial ownership reporting. The amendments generally shorten the filing deadlines for initial and amended beneficial ownership reports filed on Schedules 13D and 13G. The amendments also clarify the disclosure requirements of Schedule 13D with respect to derivative securities. We also are expanding the timeframe within a given business day by which Schedules 13D and 13G must be filed, and separately requiring that Schedule 13D and 13G filings be made using a structured, machine-readable data language. Further, we discuss how, under the current rules, an investor's use of a cash-settled derivative security may result in the person being treated as a beneficial owner of the class of the reference equity security. We also are providing guidance on the application of the current legal standard found in section 13(d)(3) and 13(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to certain common types of shareholder engagement activities. Finally, we are making certain technical revisions.

Forest Service regulations generally prohibit floating activities on the Chattooga Wild and Scenic River unless authorized by a permit. On January 31, 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service issued decisions to change some of the locations where, and conditions under which, boating would be allowed. The 2012 decision included segments of the Chattooga Wild and Scenic River in North Carolina, which was not included in the original rule.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final order to revoke the approved method for detecting residues of carbadox, a carcinogenic new animal drug used in swine feed. An approved method is required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as implemented by regulation, to show that no residue of carcinogenic concern from a new animal drug persists in any edible tissue or in any food derived from treated animals. The approved method measures quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid (QCA) as a marker residue to detect the presence of any residue of carcinogenic concern. QCA is a metabolite of carbadox that FDA has judged does not present a carcinogenic risk. FDA is revoking the approved method for carbadox based on its determination that the method is inadequate to monitor the residue of carcinogenic concern in compliance with FDA's operational definition of no residue because there is no established relationship between the concentration of QCA residues as measured by the approved method and the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in response to a request under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended, from the City of Cordova, Alaska, propose to authorize nonlethal incidental take by harassment of small numbers of the Southcentral Alaska stock of northern sea otters (Enhydra lutris kenyoni) for 1 year from the date of issuance of the incidental harassment authorization. The applicant has requested this authorization for take by harassment that may result from activities associated with pile driving and marine construction activities in Cordova, Alaska. We estimate that this project may result in the nonlethal incidental take by harassment of up to 82 northern sea otters from the Southcentral stock. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for up to 30 takes of 5 northern sea otters by Level A harassment and 790 takes of 77 northern sea otters by Level B harassment. No lethal take is requested, or expected, and no such take will be authorized.

AD 2018-03-13 required initial and repetitive visual inspections and fluorescent penetrant inspections (FPIs) of the main propeller shaft. This AD was prompted by an in-flight failure of a main propeller shaft on a GE Model CT7-9B engine, resulting in the loss of the propeller. This AD requires initial and repetitive visual inspections, FPIs, and ultrasonic inspections (USIs) of the main propeller shaft. Depending on the results of these inspections, this AD requires replacement of the main propeller shaft. As an optional terminating action to these inspections, this AD requires revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual (MM) and the operator's existing approved maintenance program or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate incorporating the tasks and reduced inspection thresholds for the main propeller shaft. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

This rulemaking adopts as final, without changes, an interim final rule amending the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adjudication regulations to establish presumptive service connection for nine rare respiratory cancers in association with presumed exposure to fine particulate matter. These presumptions apply to Veterans with a qualifying period of service, i.e., who served on active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War (hereinafter Gulf War), from August 2, 1990, onward, as well as in Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan, on or after September 19, 2001, during the Gulf War. This rulemaking implements a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that determined there is sufficient evidence to support these cancers as presumptive based on exposure to fine particulate matter during service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan during certain periods and the subsequent development of the following rare respiratory cancers: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx, SCC of the trachea, adenocarcinoma of the trachea, salivary gland-type tumors of the trachea, adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung, large cell carcinoma of the lung, salivary gland-type tumors of the lung, sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung, and typical and atypical carcinoid of the lung. The intended effect of this rulemaking is to ease the evidentiary burden of this population of Veterans who file claims with VA for these nine rare respiratory cancers.

We, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), are announcing receipt of a proposed regulatory and statutory amendment to the Wyoming coal program (Wyoming program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act). On September 25, 2018 the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council approved a number of revisions to rules governing permitting, operation, and abandonment of Class III underground injection and recovery wells associated with in situ mining of coal. Specifically, the proposed revisions update regulations to be consistent with Environmental Protection Agency Underground Injection Control regulations for class III wells, reorganize the chapter to better correlate with other key Land Quality Division (LQD) regulations and to reference existing LQD regulations and definitions, update regulations to be consistent with other Wyoming regulations pertaining to well construction, well abandonment, and aquifer exemptions, and update regulations to include current best management practices specific to in situ coal mining. This document gives the times and locations that the Wyoming program and this proposed amendment to that program are available for your inspection, the comment period during which you may submit written comments on the amendment, and the procedures that we will follow for the public hearing, if one is requested.

We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), are issuing this final rule to comply with a district court order that vacated our November 3, 2020, rule removing the gray wolf (Canis lupus) from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. As a result of the court's order, the regulatory protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), apply to the gray wolf in all or portions of the 45 U.S. States and Mexico where the species was listed at the time we issued the delisting rule. The court order went into effect on February 10, 2022, and is the subject of several consolidated, pending appeals in the Ninth Circuit. While those appeals are pending, the Service is bound by the district court's order. Thus, this final rule implements the court's order by correcting the Code of Federal Regulations and officially reinstating threatened status for gray wolf in Minnesota; endangered status for gray wolf in all or portions of the remaining 44 U.S. States and Mexico where the species was listed prior to our November 2020 delisting rule; critical habitat for gray wolf in Minnesota and Michigan; and the rule promulgated under section 4(d) of the Act for gray wolf in Minnesota. Gray wolves in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, the eastern third of Washington and Oregon, and north-central Utah (collectively, the Northern Rocky Mountains) retain their delisted status and are not affected by this final rule. This rule does not have any effect on the separate listing of the Mexican wolf subspecies (Canis lupus baileyi) as endangered under the Act.

This action proposes special conditions for the Airbus Model A321neo XLR airplane. The airplane will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is associated with flight-envelope protections, in icing and non-icing conditions, that use high-incidence protection and an alpha- floor system to automatically advance throttles when the airplane angle of attack reaches a predetermined value. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is proposing to amend our regulations to revoke the authorization for the use of brominated vegetable oil (BVO) in food. This action is being taken because there is no longer a reasonable certainty of no harm from the continued use of BVO in food. Specifically, the proposed rule would revoke the authorization for the use of BVO as a food ingredient intended to stabilize flavoring oils in fruit-flavored beverages. There are no authorizations for other uses of BVO in food.

The Department of the Army is announcing withdrawal of its Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The August 4, 2023, notice announced the Army's intention to prepare an EIS under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The EIS would have addressed potential environmental effects associated with the congressionally-mandated removal of the Confederate Memorial from Arlington National Cemetery (ANC). The Army determined the congressionally-mandated removal action is a non-discretionary action. There would be no reasonably foreseeable significant impacts from any discretionary elements of the proposed action. An EIS is therefore not needed to inform any decision-making for this action. The Army will prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) to analyze and disclose any effects of the discretionary elements of the proposed action, including how to disassemble the Confederate Memorial.

The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 18 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Scallop Fishery off Alaska (Scallop FMP) to the Secretary of Commerce for review. If approved, Amendment 18 would revise timing requirements for Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) reports to allow more flexibility for non-annual assessments and to set scallop harvest specifications less frequently than on an annual basis. This would reduce the burden on staff and provide more time for the development of new stock assessment methods. Amendment 18 is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act), the Scallop FMP, and other applicable laws.

This document sets forth proposed rules related to certain provisions of the No Surprises Act regarding the Federal independent dispute resolution (IDR) process, which was established as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA). These proposed rules would set forth new requirements relating to the disclosure of information that group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage must include along with the initial payment or notice of denial of payment for certain items and services subject to the surprise billing protections in the No Surprises Act. These proposed rules would also require plans and issuers to communicate information by using claim adjustment reason codes (CARCs) and remittance advice remark codes (RARCs), as specified in guidance, when providing any paper or electronic remittance advice to an entity that does not have a contractual relationship with the plan or issuer. This document also proposes to amend certain requirements related to the open negotiation period preceding the Federal IDR process, the initiation of the Federal IDR process, the Federal IDR dispute eligibility review, and the payment and collection of administrative fees and certified IDR entity fees. This document also proposes to define bundled payment arrangements, amend requirements related to batched items and services, and amend the rules for extensions of timeframes due to extenuating circumstances. Additionally, this document proposes to require plans and issuers to register in the Federal IDR portal.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, in support of efforts to create safe and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), is establishing the Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium ("Consortium"). The Consortium will help equip and empower the collaborative establishment of a new measurement science that will enable the identification of proven, scalable, and interoperable techniques and metrics to promote development and responsible use of safe and trustworthy AI, particularly for the most advanced AI systems, such as the most capable foundation models. NIST invites organizations to provide letters of interest describing technical expertise and products, data, and/or models to enable the development and deployment of safe and trustworthy AI systems through the AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). This notice is the initial step for NIST in collaborating with non-profit organizations, universities, other government agencies, and technology companies to address challenges associated with the development and deployment of AI. Many of these challenges were identified under the Executive Order of October 30, 2023 (The Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence) and the NIST AI RMF Roadmap. Much of this research will center on evaluations of and approaches towards safer, more trustworthy AI systems. Participation in the consortium is open to all interested organizations that can contribute their expertise, products, data, and/or models to the activities of the consortium. Selected participants will be required to enter into a consortium Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with NIST. At NIST's discretion, entities which are not permitted to enter into CRADAs pursuant to law may be allowed to participate in the Consortium pursuant to separate non-CRADA agreement.

On September 6, 2023, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a final temporary rule establishing a special use area of a 0.07 square mile area approximately five miles southeast of the community of Tavernier, on the island of Key Largo, within Federal waters of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) from September 6, 2023, through November 6, 2023. This document extends the temporary special use area an additional 60 days. The special use area prohibits all entry except for restoration activities under a valid Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) permit, continuous transit without interruption, and for law enforcement purposes from November 6, 2023, to January 5, 2024. This temporary extension is necessary to prevent or minimize destruction of, loss of, or injury to sanctuary resources, specifically to facilitate restoration activities to improve or repair living habitats through protecting coral nursery stock at this site from potential impacts caused by anchor damage and/or fishing gear. This extension is necessary to protect the corals in the temporary special use area until all of the corals are moved back to the original in-shore permitted nursery site. This temporary special use area will expire within 120 days from the date it was established.

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is amending its regulations that govern the payment of checks drawn on the United States Treasury (Treasury checks). The amendments coincide with the development of Fiscal Service's enhanced check post payment processing system, which will provide Treasury check return information to financial institutions more quickly than today. Financial institutions will receive this information through their existing communication channels with the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs), generally prior to the expiration of the time periods in which financial institutions must make Treasury check deposits available for withdrawal as prescribed by Regulation CC, Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks. Accordingly, Fiscal Service is amending its regulations so that, with certain exceptions, a financial institution will be liable if it pays a canceled Treasury check, also known as a payment over cancellation (POC), without waiting to receive the return information that would enable the financial institution to know the check has been canceled.

NMFS has received a request from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District (Corps), for the re-issuance of a previously issued incidental harassment authorization (IHA) with the only change being to the effective dates. The initial IHA authorized take of five species of marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment, incidental to construction associated with the Tillamook South Jetty Repairs in Tillamook Bay, Oregon. The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.
