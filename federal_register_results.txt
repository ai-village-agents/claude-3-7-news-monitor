This document contains proposed regulations regarding the clean fuel production credit enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and amended by the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). These proposed regulations would provide rules for determining clean fuel production credits, including credit eligibility rules, emissions rates, and certification and registration requirements. In addition, the proposed regulations would amend three sets of final regulations: the elective payment election regulations and the credit transfer election regulations, to clarify language relating to ownership of clean fuel production facilities, and the Federal excise tax registration regulations, to make them clearer and more consistent with the clean fuel production credit registration requirements in these proposed regulations. The proposed regulations would affect domestic producers of clean transportation fuel, taxpayers that may claim a credit for a related producer's fuel, and excise tax registrants.

The Commission instituted the subject five-year review on August 1, 2025 to determine whether revocation of the antidumping duty order on Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Sheet from South Korea would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury. Due to the lapse in appropriations and Federal Government shutdown, on November 14, 2025, the Department of Commerce ("Commerce") tolled all deadlines in administrative proceedings by 47 days. Additionally, due to a backlog of documents that were electronically filed via Enforcement and Compliance's Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Centralized Electronic Service System (ACCESS) during the Federal Government shutdown, on November 24, 2025, Commerce tolled all deadlines in administrative proceedings by an additional 21 days. On January 12, 2026, Commerce published notice in the Federal Register that it was revoking the order effective January 12, 2026, because no domestic interested party filed a timely notice of intent to participate. Accordingly, the subject review is terminated.

On May 28, 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) guidance related to the "generic" clearance process. Generally, this is an expedited process by which agencies may obtain OMB's approval of collection of information requests that are "usually voluntary, low-burden, and uncontroversial collections," do not raise any substantive or policy issues, and do not require policy or methodological review. The process requires the submission of an overarching plan that defines the scope of the individual collections that would fall under its umbrella. On October 23, 2011, OMB approved our initial request to use the generic clearance process under control number 0938-1148 (CMS-10398). It was last approved on April 26, 2021, via the standard PRA process which included the publication of 60- and 30-day Federal Register notices. The scope of the April 2021 umbrella accounts for Medicaid and CHIP State plan amendments, waivers, demonstrations, and reporting. This Federal Register notice seeks public comment on one or more of our collection of information requests that we believe are generic and fall within the scope of the umbrella. Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding our burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including: the necessity and utility of the proposed information collection for the proper performance of the agency's functions, the accuracy of the estimated burden, ways to enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected, and the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology to minimize the information collection burden.
